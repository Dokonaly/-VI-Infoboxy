'''Allan Dwan''' (3 April 1885 – 28 December 1981) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director, producer and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Born '''Joseph Aloysius Dwan''' in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, Dwan moved with his family to the United States when he was eight (8) years old, on April 15, 1893. At the [[University of Notre Dame]], he trained as an engineer and began working for a lighting company in Chicago. However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. {{cn|date=June 2014}} At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]]. {{cn|date=June 2014}}

==Career==
Dwan operated [[Flying A Studios]] in [[La Mesa, California]] from August 1911 to July 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastcountymagazine.org/node/6833|title=La mesa to honor its tinseltown roots aug. 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lamesa.patch.com/articles/100-simple-melodramas-were-made-in-la-mesa-100-years-ago|title=Proto-Hollywood: 100 Melodramas Were Made In La Mesa 100 Years Ago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On 12 August 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Ave and La Mesa Bl commemorating Dwan and the [[Flying A Studios]] origins in [[La Mesa, California]]. 

After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed 1922 ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''. Following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], in 1937 he directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi]]'' and ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' the following year. {{cn|date=June 2014}}

Dwan helped launch the career of two other very successful Hollywood directors, [[Victor Fleming]], who went on to direct ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'', and [[Marshall Neilan]], who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a career spanning almost is long career spanning 50 years, Dwan directed over 400&amp;nbsp;motion pictures, many of them highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office smash, ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. He directed his last movie in 1961. {{cn|date=June 2014}}

He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], [[Mission Hills, California]].

Allan Dwan has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6263 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

'''Bishkek''' (in [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]: Бишкéк), formerly '''Pishpek''' and '''Frunze''', is the capital and the largest city of the [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz Republic]].
Bishkek is also the administrative centre of [[Chuy Province]] which surrounds the city, even though the city itself is not part of the province but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.

According to the post-Soviet ideology, the name is thought to derive from a [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] word for a churn used to make fermented mare's milk ([[kumis]]), the Kyrgyz national drink, which is rather debatable.
Founded in 1825 as a [[Khokand]] fortress of &quot;Pishpek&quot; to control local caravan routes and to get tribute from Kyrgyz tribes, on 4 September 1860 the fortress was destroyed by Russian forces led by colonel Zimmermann, with approval of the Kyrgyz. 
In 1868 a Russian settlement was founded on the fortress's spot, adopting its original name - Pishpek, within the General Governorship of [[Russian Turkestan]] and its [[Semirechye Oblast]].

In 1925 the [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast]] was created in Russian Turkestan, promoting Pishpek as its capital. In 1926 the city was given the name ''Frunze'', after the [[Bolshevik]] military leader [[Mikhail Frunze]], who was born here. In 1936 the city of Frunze became the capital of the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] during the final stages of the [[national delimitation in the Soviet Union]].

In 1991, the Kyrgyz parliament changed the capital's name to Bishkek (without quorum though).

Bishkek is situated at about {{convert|800|m}} altitude just off the northern fringe of the [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too]] range, an extension of the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range, which rises up to {{convert|4855|m}} and provides a spectacular backdrop to the city. North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighbouring [[Kazakhstan]]. The [[Chui River]] drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the [[Turkestan-Siberia Railway]] by a [[spur line]].

Bishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous [[Khrushchyovka|Soviet-style]] apartment blocks surrounding interior courtyards and, especially outside the city centre, thousands of smaller privately built houses. It is laid out on a grid pattern, with most streets flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels that water the innumerable trees which provide shade in the hot summers.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Bishkek}}

===Kokhand Rule===

Originally a caravan rest stop (possibly founded by the [[Sogdians]]) on one of the branches of the [[Silk Road]] through the [[Tian Shan]] range, the location was fortified in 1825 by the [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] khan of [[Kokhand]] with a mud fort. In the last years of Kokhand rule the fortress was led by Atabek, the Datka.

===Tsarist Era===

In 1860, the fort was conquered and razed by the military forces of colonel Zimmermann when [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]] annexed the area. Colonel [[Zimmermann|Zimmerman]] rebuilt the town over the destroyed fort and put field poruchik Titov as a head of new Russian [http://militera.lib.ru/h/pishpek/02.html garrison]. The site was redeveloped from 1877 onward by the Russian government, which encouraged the settlement of Russian peasants by giving them fertile land to develop.

===Soviet Era===
[[File:Michael Frunze Statue vor dem Bahnhof von Bischkek.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Frunze statue near the railway station]]
In 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast|Kirghiz ASSR]] and was renamed &quot;Frunze&quot; after [[Mikhail Frunze]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] close associate who was born in Bishkek and played key roles during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|revolutions of 1905]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1917|1917]] and during the [[Russian civil war]] of the early 1920s.

===Independence Era===

The early 1990s were tumultuous. In June 1990, a state of emergency was declared following severe ethnic riots in southern Kyrgyzstan which threatened to spread to the capital. The city was renamed Bishkek on 5 February 1991 and Kyrgyzstan achieved independence later that year during the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|breakup of the Soviet Union]]. Before independence, the majority of Bishkek's population was ethnic [[Russian people|Russians]]. In 2004, Russians made up approximately 20% of the city's population, and about 7–8% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3681/is_200407/ai_n9472919 Residential Real Estate Market in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan: Current Conditions and Prospects]{{dead link|date=March 2012}} {{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Bishkek is a modern city, with many restaurants and cafes and with many second-hand European and Japanese cars and minibuses crowding its streets. Streets and sidewalks have fallen into disrepair since the 1990s. At the same time Bishkek still preserves its former Soviet feel, with Soviet-period buildings and gardens prevailing over newer structures.

Bishkek is also the country's financial centre, with all of the country's 21 commercial banks keeping headquarters in the city. During the Soviet era, the city was home to a large number of industrial plants, but most have been shut down since 1991 or operate today on a much reduced scale. One of Bishkek's largest employment centres today is [[Dordoy Bazaar|Dordoy Bazaar open market]], which is one of the major sale place of Chinese goods imported to [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries.

==Geography==

===Orientation===
Though the city is relatively young, the surrounding area has some sites of interest dating from prehistory, the [[Greco-Buddhist]] period, the period of [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] influence, the era of the Central Asian ''[[khanate]]s'', and the Soviet period.

The central part of the city is primarily built on a rectangular grid plan. The city's main street is the east–west Chui Avenue ([[Chuy Prospekti]]), named after the region's [[Chui River|main river]]. In the Soviet era, it was called [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] Avenue. Along, or within a block or two from it, many of the most important government buildings, universities, the [[Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] compound, and so on, are to be found. The westernmost section of the avenue is known as [[Deng Xiaoping]] Avenue.

The main north–south axis is [[Yusup Abdrakhmanov]] Street, still commonly referred to by its old name, ''Sovietskaya Street''. Its northern and southern sections are called, respectively, Yelebesov and Baityk Batyr Streets. Several major shopping centres are located along it, and in the north it provides access to [[Dordoy Bazaar]].

Erkindik (&quot;Freedom&quot;) Boulevard runs from north to south, from the main railroad station (Bishkek II) south of Chui Avenue to the museum quarter and sculpture park just north of Chui Avenue, and further north toward the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past, it was called Dzerzhinsky Boulevard—named after a Communist revolutionary, [[Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky|Felix Dzerzhinsky]]—and its northern continuation is still called Dzerzhinsky Street.

An important east–west street is Jibek Jolu ('[[Silk Road]]'). It runs parallel to Chui Avenue about a mile north of it, and is part of the main east–west road of [[Chui Province]]. Both the Eastern and Western bus terminals are located along Jibek Jolu.

There is a Roman Catholic church located at ul. Vasiljeva 197 (near Rynok Bayat). This is the only Catholic Cathedral in Kyrgyzstan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-kyrgyzstan.org/ Catholic Church in Kyrgyzstan]. Catholic-kyrgyzstan.org. Retrieved 11 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===City centre===
[[File:Bishkek square.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ala-Too Square]], {{nowrap|Bishkek's main square}}]]
* State Historical Museum, located in [[Ala-Too Square]], the main city square
* State Museum of Applied Arts, containing examples of Kyrgyz traditional [[handicraft]]s
* Frunze House Museum
* Statue of [[Ivan Panfilov]] stands in the park near the [[White House (Bishkek)|White House]].
* An [[equestrian statue]] of [[Mikhail Frunze]] still stands in a large park (Boulevard Erkindik) across from the train station.
* The train station itself was built in 1946 by German prisoners of war and has survived since then without further renovation or repairs; most of those who built it perished and were buried in unmarked pits near the station.
* The main government building, the [[White House (Bishkek)|White House]], is a huge, seven story marble block and the former headquarters of the Communist Party of the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz SSR]]
* At Ala-Too Square, there is an Independence monument where the changing of the guards may be watched.
* [[Osh bazaar]], west of the downtown area, is a large, picturesque produce market

===Outer neighbourhoods===
The [[Dordoy Bazaar]], just inside the bypass highway on the north-eastern edge of the city, is a major retail and wholesale market.

===Outside the city===
The [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too]] mountain range, some {{convert|40|km}} away, provides a spectacular backdrop to the city; the [[Ala Archa National Park]] is only a 30 to 45 minutes drive away.

===Climate===
Bishkek has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfa/Dwa/Dsa: Hot (or very warm) summer subtype|Dsa]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Asia_Koppen_Map.png |title=Koppen Map |publisher=Upload.wikimedia.org |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; averaging 322 clear days annually due to its mountainous location. Average [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is around {{convert|440|mm}} per year. Average daily high temperatures range from {{convert|-3|°C|1}} in January to about {{convert|31|°C|1}} during July.&lt;ref name = Pogoda /&gt; The summer months are dominated by dry periods experiencing the occasional [[thunderstorm]] which produces strong gusty winds and rare [[dust storm]]s. The mountains to the south provide a natural boundary to provide protection from much of the damaging weather along with the smaller chain which runs NW to SE. In the winter months, sparse [[Winter storm|snow storms]] and frequent heavy [[fog]] are the dominating features. When an inversion sets up, the fog can last for days at a time.

==Ecology and environment==

===Air quality===
Emissions of air pollutants in Bishkek amounted to 14,400 tons in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteo.ktnet.kg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.kg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=11&amp;lang=ru |title=Анализ загрязнения атмосферы |publisher=Nature.kg |date= |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all other cities of Kyrgyzstan, the level of air pollution in Bishkek is the highest with occasional exceeding maximum allowable concentrations by several times, especially in the city's center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.kg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=11&amp;lang=ru Web-site of the State Agency on Environment Protection and Forestry: Assessment of Air Pollution]. Meteo.ktnet.kg. Retrieved on 11 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, occasionally formaldehyde concentrations exceed maximum allowable ones by four times.

Responsibility for ambient air quality monitoring in Bishkek lies on Kyrgyz State Agency on Hydrometeorology. In total, there are seven air quality monitoring stations in Bishkek, measuring levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, and ammonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteo.ktnet.kg&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:E7919-Dordoy-Bazaar-clothing.jpg|thumb|[[Dordoy Bazaar]]]]
Bishkek uses the Kyrgyzstan currency, the [[Kyrgyzstani som|som]]. The Som's value fluctuates regularly, but averages around 47 som per U.S. Dollar as of March 2011. The economy in Bishkek is primarily agricultural with the mass amounts of fruits,  vegetables and livestock providing a co-existing system of bartering in the outlying regions. The streets of Bishkek are regularly lined with produce vendors in a market style venue. In the major portions of downtown there is a more urban cityscape with banks, stores, markets and malls. The most sought after of the goods are the prevalent hand-crafted artisan pieces; these include statues, carvings, paintings and many nature based sculptures.

==Government==
Local government is administered by the Bishkek Mayor's Office.  [[Askarbek Salymbekov]] was mayor until his resignation in August 2005, following which his deputy [[Arstanbek Nogoev]] took over the mayorship. Nogoev was in turn removed from his position in October 2007 through a decree of President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] and replaced by businessman and former first deputy prime minister [[Daniar Usenov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=182916&amp;Itemid=7|publisher=The Times of Central Asia|title=New mayor of Bishkek promises to solve capital’s problems|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=18 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024001610/http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=182916&amp;Itemid=7 |archivedate = 24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503|journal=Eurasia Daily Monitor|publisher=The Jamestown Foundation|volume=4|issue=190|last=Marat|first=Erica|title=Upcoming referendum sinks Kyrgyzstan deeper into crisis|date=15 October 2007|accessdate=18 October 2007  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071022122621/http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503 |archivedate = 22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kyrgyz capital gets new mayor|url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2005/05-08-22.rferl.html#20|publisher=Radio Free Europe|date=22 August 2005|accessdate=18 October 2007|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKgVssqi |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008 former head of the Kyrgyz Railways [[Nariman Tuleyev]] was appointed mayor, who was dismissed by the interim government after 7 April 2010.

===Mass public transport===
There is public transportation available, including buses, electric [[trolley bus]]es, and public vans (known in Russian as ''[[marshrutka]]''). The first bus and trolley bus services in Bishkek were introduced in 1934 and 1951 correspondingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Frunze. City Encyclopedia.  | publisher = | date = | url = http://yiv1999.narod.ru/ABC_0040.htm#6300| accessdate = 2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxi cabs can be found throughout the city.

There is no subway in Bishkek, but the city is considering designing and building a light rail system ([[:ru:Бишкекское лёгкое метро|Бишкекское лёгкое метро]]).

===Commuter and long-distance buses===
There are two main bus stations in Bishkek. The smaller old Eastern Bus Station is primarily the terminal for minibuses to various destinations within or just beyond the eastern suburbs, such as [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]], [[Tokmok]], [[Kemin]], [[Issyk Ata]], or the [[Korday]] border crossing.

Long-distance regular bus and minibus services to all parts of the country, as well as to [[Almaty]] (the largest city in neighboring [[Kazakhstan]]) and [[Kashgar]], China, run mostly from the newer grand Western Bus Station; only a smaller minority of them runs from the Eastern Station.

The Dordoy Bazaar on the north-eastern outskirts of the city also contains makeshift terminals for frequent minibuses to suburban towns in all directions (from [[Sokuluk]] in the west to [[Tokmok|Tokmak]] in the east) and to some buses taking traders to Kazakhstan and Siberia.

===Rail===
As of 2007, the Bishkek railway station sees only a few trains a day. It offers a popular three-day train service from Bishkek to Moscow.

There are also long-distance trains that leave for Siberia ([[Novosibirsk]] and [[Novokuznetsk]]), via [[Almaty]], over the [[Turksib]] route, and to [[Yekaterinburg]] (Sverdlovsk) in the Urals, via [[Astana]]. These services are remarkably slow (over 48 hours to Yekaterinburg), due to long stops at the border and the indirect route (the trains first have to go west for more than a {{convert|100|km}} before they enter the main [[Turksib]] line and can continue to the east or north). For example, as of the fall of 2008, train No. 305 Bishkek-Yekaterinburg was scheduled to take 11 hours to reach the [[Shu, Kazakhstan|Shu]] junction—a distance of some {{convert|269|km}} by rail, and less than half of that by road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poezda.net/ru/train_timetable?st_code=2708000&amp;order=&amp;forDate=3 |title=Маршрут поезда ????? - ????? на сайте |publisher=Poezda.net |date= |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
The city is served by [[Manas International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] code FRU), located approximately {{convert|25|km}} northwest of the city centre, and readily reachable by taxi.

In 2002, the United States obtained the right to use Manas International Airport as an [[Manas Air Base|air base]] for its military operations in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. Russia subsequently (2003) established an air base of its own ([[Kant (air base)|Kant Air Base]]) near [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]] some {{convert|20|km}} east of Bishkek. It is based at a facility that used to be home to a major Soviet military pilot training school; one of its students, [[Hosni Mubarak]], later became president of [[Egypt]].

===In popular culture===
In [[Command &amp; Conquer: Generals]],GLA forces held this city,capital of unified [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]].They reinforced their forces by railways connected to other areas and locals enraged at the Chinese presence in the area.Black Lotus and her strike team must destroy the bridge and a sports stadium before they are overrun,due to the nature of the mission,a covert op,they are reduced to a minimal.

In June 2009, the [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), relying on information obtained from the ''CIA World Factbook'', put the number of Israeli Jews living in settlements in the [[West Bank]] and Israeli-annexed [[East Jerusalem]] at 250,000. However, a better estimate, based on [[United States Department of State|State Department]] and Israeli sources put the figure at about 500,000. NPR then issued a correction.

Various demographic information is full of usually minor errors, inaccuracies, and out-of-date information, which are often repeated elsewhere due to the ''Factbook''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s widespread use as a reference. For example, [[Albania]] was. until recently, described in the ''Factbook'' as 70% [[Muslim]], 20% [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], and 10% [[Roman Catholic]], which was based on a survey conducted in 1939, before [[World War II]]; numerous surveys conducted since the fall of the Communist regime since 1990 have given quite different figures. Another example is [[Singapore]], which the ''Factbook'' states has a [[total fertility rate]] of 0.78 children per woman, despite figures in Statistics Singapore which state that the rate has been about 1.2–1.3 children per woman for at least the past several years, and it is unclear when, or even whether, it ever dropped as low as 0.78.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/latest_data.html#14 Statistics Singapore - Latest Data].

Before 1998, the [[United Kingdom]] profile contained a sentence that asserted the UK had gained independence on 1 January 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author =  Directorate of Intelligence | title = The World Factbook – United Kingdom (mirror) |year= 1996 | url =  http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact96/258.htm | accessdate = September 23, 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This description in reference to the [[Act of Union 1801]] which expanded the United Kingdom of Great Britain to include Ireland, has since been greatly expanded,&lt;ref name=&quot;uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author =  Directorate of Intelligence | title = The World Factbook – United Kingdom |date= 2006-09-19 | url =  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uk.html | accessdate = 2006-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the primary date of UK Independence is now given as 1927. This has been argued by some as misleading, and refers to the date the entity adopted its current name under the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act]], of that year. Indeed it can be argued the country has no one year in which independence was achieved, since there is an arguable legitimate succession of states, systems and entities from the [[Norman Conquest]], 1066.

The '''Cook Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Cook Islands.ogg|ˈ|k|ʊ|k|_|ˈ|aɪ|l|ən|d|z}}; [[Cook Islands Māori]]: ''Kūki 'Āirani''&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C ''Cook Islands Maori dictionary''] by Jasper Buse &amp; Raututi Taringa, Cook Islands Ministry of Education (1995) page 200&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[island country]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific Ocean]] in [[Associated state|free association]] with [[New Zealand]]. It comprises 15 small islands whose total land area is {{convert|240|km2|sqmi|1}}. The Cook Islands' [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ), however, covers {{convert|1800000|km2|sqmi}} of ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070214035426/http://www.sopac.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Cook+Islands A View from the Cook Islands]. SOPAC&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cook Islands' defence and foreign affairs are the responsibility of New Zealand, which is exercised in consultation with the Cook Islands. In recent times, the Cook Islands have adopted an increasingly independent foreign policy. Although [[Cook Islanders]] are [[New Zealand nationality law|citizens of New Zealand]], they have the status of [[Cook Islander|Cook Islands nationals]], which is not given to other New Zealand citizens.

The Cook Islands' main population centres are on the island of [[Rarotonga]] (14,153 in 2006), where there is an international airport. There is a much larger population of Cook Islanders in New Zealand, particularly the [[North Island]]. In the 2006 census, 58,008 self-identified as being of ethnic [[Cook Islands Māori]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/census/2006-census-data/quickstats-about-culture-identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity.htm?page=para016Master|title=QuickStats About Culture and Identity – Pacific Peoples|accessdate=12 June 2007|work=2006 Census|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070829173025/http://www.stats.govt.nz/census/2006-census-data/quickstats-about-culture-identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity.htm?page=para016Master |archivedate=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of the Cook Islands}}
[[Image:Wyspy Cooka.png|left|thumb|Map of the Cook Islands.]]

The Cook Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean, northeast of New Zealand, between [[French Polynesia]] and [[American Samoa]]. There are 15&amp;nbsp;major islands spread over 2.2&amp;nbsp;million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of ocean, divided into two distinct groups: the Southern Cook Islands and the Northern Cook Islands of [[Atoll|coral atolls]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cook Islands Travel Guide&quot; (with description), ''World Travel Guide'', Nexus Media Communications, 2006. Webpage: [http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/65/country_guide/Australia-and-South-Pacific/Cook-Islands.html WTGuide-Cook-Islands].&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands were formed by [[volcanic]] activity; the northern group is older and consists of six atolls, which are sunken volcanoes topped by [[coral]] growth. The climate is moderate to tropical.

The 15 islands and two reefs are grouped as follows:
* Southern Cook Islands:
** [[Nga-pu-Toru]] (&quot;Three Roots&quot;, the eastern islands):
*** [[Atiu]] (Enua Manu or Island of Birds)
*** [[Ma'uke]] (Akatokamanava)
*** [[Mitiaro]] (Nukuroa)
*** [[Takutea]]
* Northern Cook Islands:
** [[Manihiki]] (Te Fuinga o Niva)
** [[Nassau (Cook Islands)|Nassau]] (Te Nuku o Ngalewu )
** [[Penrhyn Island]] (Tongareva or Mangarongaro)
** [[Pukapuka]] (Te Ulu o te Watu)
** [[Rakahanga]] (Tapuahua)
** [[Suwarrow]] also called Suvorov
** [[Tema Reef]] (submerged)
* Other islands:
** [[Aitutaki]] (Araura Enua)
** [[Mangaia]] (Auau Enua)
** [[Rarotonga]] (Tumutevarovaro), with the capital, Avarua.
** [[Palmerston Island]] (Pamati) sometimes grouped with the Northern Group.
** [[Manuae (Cook Islands)|Manuae]]
** [[Winslow Reef, Cook Islands|Winslow Reef]] (submerged)

==History==
{{Main|History of the Cook Islands}}

[[Image:rarotonga beach.jpg|thumb|left|Beach on [[Rarotonga]]]]
The Cook Islands were first settled in the 6th century [[Common Era|CE]] by [[Polynesian people]] who migrated from [[Tahiti]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120319005759/http://www.samoa2007.ws/index.php?id=224 Cook Islands] (archived from [http://www.samoa2007.ws/index.php?id=224 the original] on 19 March 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; an island 1154&amp;nbsp;km to the northeast of Cook Islands.

Spanish ships visited the islands in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century; the first written record of contact with the islands came with the sighting of [[Pukapuka]] by Spanish sailor [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]] in 1595 who called it ''San Bernardo'' (Saint Bernard). [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], a Portuguese captain working for the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish crown]], made the first recorded European landing in the islands when he set foot on [[Rakahanga]] in 1606, calling it ''Gente Hermosa'' (Beautiful People).
&lt;ref&gt;[http://findingnz.co.nz/av/gav22.htm European discovery of the Cook Islands by Brian Hooker]. Findingnz.co.nz. Retrieved on 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

British navigator Captain [[James Cook]] arrived in 1773 and 1777&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Nicholas (2003). ''Cook : the extraordinary voyages of Captain James Cook'', Walker &amp; Company, ISBN 0802714129, pp. 310–311.&lt;/ref&gt; and named the islands the ''Hervey Islands''; the name &quot;Cook Islands&quot;, in honour of Cook, appeared on a Russian naval chart published in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/history.php|title=Cook Islands Government website|publisher=Cook-islands.gov.ck|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1813 [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], a missionary on the ''Endeavour'' (not the same ship as Cook's) made the first recorded sighting of [[Rarotonga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chr.org.au/fpbooks/tendecades/TEN%20DECADES%20Chapter%203.doc|title=Ten Decades: The Australasian Centenary History of the London Missionary Society, Rev. Joseph King (Word document)|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=February 2013|John Williams}} The first recorded landing on Rarotonga by Europeans was in 1814 by the ''Cumberland''; trouble broke out between the sailors and the Islanders and many were killed on both sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ck/history.htm|title=History of the Cook Islands|publisher=Ck|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands saw no more Europeans until missionaries arrived from England in 1821. Christianity quickly took hold in the culture and many islanders continue to be Christian believers today.

The Cook Islands became a British [[protectorate]] in 1888, due largely to community fears that France might occupy the territory as it had Tahiti. In 1901 the New Zealand Government decided to annexe the country despite opposition from the country's traditional chiefs. As many of the islands were independent and ruled by local chiefs, the Cook Islands had no federal statutory law to decide the constitutional constraints regarding whether to agree to the country's annexation. When the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 came into effect on 1 January 1949, Cook Islanders who were British subjects gained [[New Zealand citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/citizenship/3 3. Aliens and citizens – Citizenship – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]. Teara.govt.nz (4 March 2009). Retrieved on 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The country remained a New Zealand protectorate until&amp;nbsp;1965, when the New Zealand Government decided to offer self-governing status to its colony. In that year, [[Albert Henry (politician)|Albert Henry]] of the [[Cook Islands Party]] was elected as the first Prime Minister. Henry led the country until he was accused of vote-rigging. He was succeeded in 1978 by [[Tom Davis (Cook Islands)|Tom Davis]] of the [[Democratic Party (Cook Islands)|Democratic Party]].

==Politics and foreign relations==
{{Main|Politics of the Cook Islands|Foreign relations of the Cook Islands}}
[[Image:Parliament of the Cook Islands - 2006.JPG|thumb|The parliament building of the Cook Islands, formerly a hotel.]]

The Cook Islands is a [[representative democracy]] with a [[parliamentary system]] in an [[associated state]] relationship with New Zealand. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, with the Chief Minister as [[head of government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Parliament of the Cook Islands]]. There is a pluriform multi-party system. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. The [[Head of State]] is the [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Queen of New Zealand]], who is represented in the Cook Islands by the [[Queen's Representative]].

The islands are self-governing in &quot;free association&quot; with [[New Zealand]]. New Zealand retains primary responsibility for external affairs, with consultation with the Cook Islands government. Cook Islands nationals are citizens of New Zealand and can receive New Zealand government services, but the reverse is not true; New Zealand citizens are not Cook Islands nationals. Despite this, as of 2013, the Cook Islands had diplomatic relations in its own name with 41 other countries. The Cook Islands is not a United Nations member state, but, along with [[Niue]], has had their &quot;full treaty-making capacity&quot; recognised by [[United Nations Secretariat]],&lt;ref name=art102&gt;{{citation |format=PDF |url=http://legal.un.org/repertory/art102/english/rep_supp8_vol6-art102_e_advance.pdf |title=Repertory of Practice |publisher=UN |contribution=Organs Supplement |number=8 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=map&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/world00.pdf |publisher=UN |title=The World today |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a full member of the [[WHO]] and [[UNESCO]] [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|UN specialised agencies]], is an associate member of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ([[UNESCAP]]) and a Member of the Assembly of States of the [[International Criminal Court]].

On 11 June 1980, the United States signed [[Cook Islands – United States Maritime Boundary Treaty|a treaty]] with the Cook Islands specifying the [[maritime boundary|maritime border]] between the Cook Islands and [[American Samoa]] and also relinquishing any United States claim to the islands of [[Penrhyn Island|Penrhyn]], [[Pukapuka]], [[Manihiki]], and [[Rakahanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pits/en/treaty_database/1980/6.html|title=Treaty Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands on Friendship and Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands (and Exchange of Notes)|work=Pacific Islands Treaty Series|publisher=University of the South Pacific School of Law|accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the Cook Islands and France signed [[Maritime Delimitation Agreement (Cook Islands – France)|a treaty]] that [[boundary delimitation|delimited]] the boundary between the Cook Islands and [[French Polynesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pits/en/treaty_database/1990/4.html|title=Agreement on Maritime Delimitation Between the Government of the Cook Islands and the Government of the French Republic|work=Pacific Islands Treaty Series|publisher=University of the South Pacific School of Law|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As competition between the US and China heated up in the South China Sea and other areas closer to the mainland, even the far off Cook Islands began to feel the results. In late August 2012, for instance, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] visited the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/trvl/2012/196973.htm|title=Secretary Clinton:Travel to the Cook Islands, Indonesia, China, Timor-Leste, Brunai, and Russia|accessdate=4 September 2012|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-south-pacific-20120829,0,4251912.story|title=Hillary Clinton's visit underscores new value of Cook Islands|newspaper=[[LA Times]]|last=Richter|first=Paul|date=29 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative subdivisions==
There are Island Councils on all of the inhabited outer islands (Outer Islands Local Government Act 1987 with amendments up to&amp;nbsp;2004, and Palmerston Island Local Government Act 1993) except [[Nassau (Cook Islands)|Nassau]], which is governed by [[Pukapuka]] ([[Suwarrow]], with only one caretaker living on the island, also governed by Pukapuka, is not counted with the inhabited islands in this context). Each council is headed by a Mayor.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Cook Islands}}
The economy is strongly affected by geography. It is isolated from foreign markets, and has some inadequate infrastructure; it lacks major natural resources, has limited manufacturing and suffers moderately from natural disasters. Tourism provides the economic base which makes up approximately 67.5% of GDP.
Additionally, the economy is supported by foreign aid, largely from New Zealand. The Peoples' Republic of China has also contributed foreign aid which has resulted in, among other projects, the Police Headquarters building. The Cook Islands is expanding its agriculture, mining and fishing sectors, with varying success.

Since approximately 1989, the Cook Islands have become a location specialising in so-called [[asset-protection trusts#Cook Islands|asset protection trusts]], by which investors shelter assets from the reach of creditors and legal authorities.&lt;ref name=flyspeck/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Offshore Jurisdictions: Cook Islands|url=http://protectyou.com/1996/01/review-of-offshore-jurisdictions-part-1/|publisher=The Asset Protection News|last1=Rosen |first1=Howard |last2=Donlevy-Rosen |first2=Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', the Cooks have &quot;laws devised to protect foreigners' assets from legal claims in their home countries&quot; which were apparently crafted specifically to thwart the long arm of American justice; creditors must travel to the Cook Islands and argue their cases under Cooks law, often at prohibitive expense.&lt;ref name=flyspeck/&gt; Unlike other foreign jurisdictions such as the [[British Virgin Islands]], the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Switzerland]], the Cooks &quot;generally disregard foreign court orders&quot; and do not require that bank accounts, real estate, or other assets protected from scrutiny (it is illegal to disclose names or any information about Cooks trusts) be physically located within the archipelago.&lt;ref name=flyspeck&gt;Wayne, Leslie.

===Art===

====Carving====
[[File:Cook Islands carved wood figure, British Museum.jpg|thumb|This wooden late eighteenth or early nineteenth century carved figure escaped emasculation, despite its missionary collectors. Only one other comparable example is known apart from this one in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Highlights [http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/w/wooden_figure.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]

[[Woodcarving]] is a common art form in the Cook Islands. The proximity of islands in the southern group helped produce a homogeneous style of carving but which had special developments in each island. Rarotonga is known for its fisherman's gods and staff-gods, [[Atiu]] for its wooden seats, [[Mitiaro]], [[Mauke]] and Atiu for mace and slab gods and [[Mangaia]] for its ceremonial adzes. Most of the original wood carvings were either spirited away by early European collectors or were burned in large numbers by missionary zealots. Today, carving is no longer the major art form with the same spiritual and cultural emphasis given to it by the Maori in New Zealand. However, there are continual efforts to interest young people in their heritage and some good work is being turned out under the guidance of older carvers. Atiu, in particular, has a strong tradition of crafts both in carving and local fibre arts such as tapa. Mangaia is the source of many fine adzes carved in a distinctive, idiosyncratic style with the so-called double-k design. Mangaia also produces food pounders carved from the heavy calcite found in its extensive limestone caves.

====Weaving====
The outer islands produce traditional [[weaving]] of mats, basketware and hats. Particularly fine examples of rito hats are worn by women to church. They are made from the uncurled immature fibre of the coconut palm and are of very high quality. The Polynesian equivalent of Panama hats, they are highly valued and are keenly sought by Polynesian visitors from Tahiti. Often, they are decorated with hatbands made of minuscule pupu shells which are painted and stitched on by hand. Although pupu are found on other islands the collection and use of them in decorative work has become a speciality of Mangaia. The weaving of rito is a speciality of the northern island of Penrhyn.

====Tivaevae====
A major art form in the Cook Islands is [[tivaevae]]. This is, in essence, the art of handmade Island scenery patchwork quilts. Introduced by the wives of missionaries in the 19th century, the craft grew into a communal activity and is probably one of the main reasons for its popularity.

====Contemporary art====
The Cook Islands has produced internationally recognised contemporary artists, especially in the main island of Rarotonga. Artists include painter (and photographer) Mahiriki Tangaroa, sculptors Eruera (Ted) Nia (originally a film maker) and master carver Mike Tavioni, painter (and Polynesian tattoo enthusiast) Upoko'ina Ian George, Aitutakian-born painter Tim Manavaroa Buchanan, Loretta Reynolds, Judith Kunzlé, Joan Rolls Gragg, Kay George (who is also known for her fabric designs), Apii Rongo, Varu Samuel, and multi-media, installation and community-project artist Ani O'Neil, all of whom currently live on the main island of Rarotonga. Atiuan-based Andrea Eimke is an artist who works in the medium of tapa and other textiles, and also co-authored the book 'Tivaivai – The Social Fabric of the Cook Islands' with British academic Susanne Kuechler. Many of these artists have studied at university art schools in New Zealand and continue to enjoy close links with the New Zealand art scene.

New Zealand-based Cook Islander artists include Michel Tuffrey, print-maker David Teata, Richard Shortland Cooper, Sylvia Marsters and Jim Vivieaere.

On Rarotonga, the main commercial galleries are Beachcomber Contemporary Art (Taputapuatea, Avarua) run by Ben &amp; Trevon Bergman, and The Art Gallery ('Arorangi). The Cook Islands National Museum also exhibits art.

The '''[[Cook Islands]]''' are named after [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]], who visited the islands in 1773 and 1777.&lt;ref&gt;''Cook : the Extraordinary voyages of Captain James Cook'', 2003, by Nicholas Thomas, pages 310-311.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cook Islands]] became a British [[protectorate]] in 1888.

By 1900, administrative control was transferred to [[New Zealand]]; in 1965 residents chose self-government in free association with New Zealand.

The Cook Islands contain 15 islands in the group spread over a vast area in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. The majority of islands are low coral atolls in the Northern Group, with [[Rarotonga]], a volcanic island in the Southern Group, as the main administration and government centre. The main Cook Islands language is [[Cook Islands Maori|Rarotongan Māori]]. There are some variations in dialect in the 'outer' islands.

==History==
The Cook Islands were first settled around 600 [[Anno Domini|AD]] by [[Polynesian people]] who migrated from nearby [[Tahiti]] to the northeast. Overpopulation on many of the tiny islands of Polynesia led to these oceanic migrations. Tradition has it that this was the reason for the expedition of Ru, from Tupua'i in French Polynesia, who landed on [[Aitutaki]], and Tangiia, also from French Polynesia, both of whom are believed to have arrived on [[Rarotonga]] around 800 AD. These arrivals are evidenced by an older road in Toi, the ''Ara Metua'', which runs around most of Rarotonga, and is believed to be at least 1200 years old. This 29&amp;nbsp;km long, paved road is a considerable achievement of ancient engineering, possibly unsurpassed elsewhere in Polynesia.&lt;ref name=wondermondo&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Au/NZ/Cook/AraMetua.htm|title=Ara Metua - ancient Polynesian road|publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands of Manihiki and Rakahanga trace their origins to the arrival of Toa (an outcast from Rarotonga) and Tupaeru (a woman of high-ranking in the Puaikura tribe of Rarotonga)The remainder of the northern islands were probably settled by expeditions from [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ck/history.htm History of the Cook Islands www.ck]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spain|Spanish]] ships visited the islands in the 16th century; the first written record of contact from Europeans with the native inhabitants of the Cook Islands came with the sighting of [[Pukapuka]] by Spanish sailor [[Álvaro de Mendaña]] in 1595 who called it ''San Bernardo'' (Saint Bernard). Portuguese-Spaniard [[Pedro Fernández de Quirós]] made the first recorded European landing in the islands when he set foot on [[Rakahanga]] in 1606, calling it ''Gente Hermosa'' (Beautiful People).&lt;ref name=&quot;findingnz.co.nz&quot;&gt;[http://findingnz.co.nz/av/gav22.htm European discovery of the Cook Islands by Brian Hooker]&lt;/ref&gt;

British navigator Captain [[James Cook]] arrived in 1773 and 1777; Cook named the islands the 'Hervey Islands' to honour a British Lord of the Admiralty; Half a century later the Russian [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] Admiral [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] published the ''Atlas de l'Ocean Pacifique'', in which he renamed the islands the Cook Islands to honour Cook. [[Captain Cook]] navigated and mapped much of the group. Surprisingly, Cook never sighted the largest island, [[Rarotonga]], and the only island that he personally set foot on was tiny, uninhabited [[Palmerston Island|Palmerston Atoll]].&lt;ref&gt;Lonely Planet Guidebook : Rarotonga &amp; the Cook Islands, by Errol Hunt &amp; Nancy J. Keller p10-11 ISBN 1-74059-083-X&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.chr.org.au/fpbooks/tendecades/TEN%20DECADES%20Chapter%203.doc] The first recorded landing by Europeans was in 1814 by the Cumberland; trouble broke out between the sailors and the Islanders and many were killed on both sides.

The islands saw no more Europeans until missionaries arrived from England in 1821. Christianity quickly took hold in the culture and retains that grip today.

In 1823, [[Captain John Dibbs]] of the colonial barque Endeavour made the first official sighting of the island [[Rarotonga]]. The Endeavour was transporting Rev. [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]] on a missionary voyage to the islands.

Brutal [[Peruvian]] [[slave traders]], known as [[blackbirding|blackbirders]], took a terrible toll on the islands of the Northern Group in 1862 and 1863. At first the traders may have genuinely operated as labour recruiters, but they quickly turned to subterfuge and outright kidnapping to round up their human cargo. The [[Cook Islands]] was not the only island group visited by the traders, but [[Penrhyn Island|Penrhyn Atoll]] was their first port of call and it has been estimated that three-quarters of the population was taken to [[Callao]], [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;Discoverers Of The Cook Islands And The Names They Gave, by Alphons M.J. Kloosterman Chap 10. Penrhyn&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rakahanga]] and [[Pukapuka]] also suffered tremendous losses.&lt;ref&gt;Lonely Planet Guidebook : Rarotonga &amp; the Cook Islands, by Errol Hunt &amp; Nancy J. Keller p11-12 ISBN 1-74059-083-X&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kingdom of Rarotonga]] was established in 1858 and in 1888 it became a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[protectorate]] by the request of [[Queen Makea Takau]], mainly to thwart French expansionism. Then later were transferred to New Zealand in 1901. They remained a New Zealand protectorate until 1965, at which point they became a [[self-government|self-governing]] territory in [[Associated state|free association]] with New Zealand. The first Prime Minister Sir [[Albert Henry (politician)|Albert Henry]] led the county until 1978 when he was accused of [[vote-rigging]].

Today, the Cook Islands are essentially independent (self-governing in free association with New Zealand), {{citation needed span|text=but are still officially placed under New Zealand [[sovereignty]].|date=January 2014}} New Zealand is tasked with overseeing the country's foreign relations and defense. The Cook Islands, [[Niue]], New Zealand (and its territories: [[Tokelau]] and the [[Ross Dependency]]) make up the [[Realm of New Zealand]].

After achieving autonomy in 1965, the Cook Islands elected [[Albert Henry (politician)|Albert Henry]] of the [[Cook Islands Party]] as their first [[Prime Minister]]. He was succeeded in 1978 by [[Tom Davis (Cook Islands)|Tom Davis]] of the [[Democratic Party (Cook Islands)|Democratic Party]].

On 11 June 1980, the [[United States]] signed [[Cook Islands – United States Maritime Boundary Treaty|a treaty]] with the Cook Islands specifying the maritime [[border]] between the Cook Islands and [[American Samoa]] and also relinquishing its claim to the islands of [[Penrhyn Island|Penrhyn]], [[Pukapuka]], [[Manihiki]], and [[Rakahanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pits/en/treaty_database/1980/6.html|title=Treaty Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands on Friendship and Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands (and Exchange of Notes)|work=Pacific Islands Treaty Series|publisher=University of the South Pacific School of Law|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the Cook Islands signed [[Cook Islands – France Maritime Delimitation Agreement|a treaty]] with [[France]] which [[boundary delimitation|delimited]] the [[maritime boundary]] between the Cook Islands and [[French Polynesia]].

On June 13, 2008, a small majority of members of the [[House of Ariki]] attempted a coup, claiming to dissolve the elected government and to take control of the country's leadership. &quot;Basically we are dissolving the leadership, the prime minister and the deputy prime minister and the ministers,&quot; chief Makea Vakatini Joseph Ariki explained.
