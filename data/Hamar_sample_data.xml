'''Allan Dwan''' (3 April 1885 – 28 December 1981) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director, producer and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Born '''Joseph Aloysius Dwan''' in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, Dwan moved with his family to the United States when he was eight (8) years old, on April 15, 1893. At the [[University of Notre Dame]], he trained as an engineer and began working for a lighting company in Chicago. However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. {{cn|date=June 2014}} At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]]. {{cn|date=June 2014}}

==Career==
Dwan operated [[Flying A Studios]] in [[La Mesa, California]] from August 1911 to July 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastcountymagazine.org/node/6833|title=La mesa to honor its tinseltown roots aug. 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lamesa.patch.com/articles/100-simple-melodramas-were-made-in-la-mesa-100-years-ago|title=Proto-Hollywood: 100 Melodramas Were Made In La Mesa 100 Years Ago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On 12 August 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Ave and La Mesa Bl commemorating Dwan and the [[Flying A Studios]] origins in [[La Mesa, California]]. 

After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed 1922 ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''. Following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], in 1937 he directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi]]'' and ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' the following year. {{cn|date=June 2014}}

Dwan helped launch the career of two other very successful Hollywood directors, [[Victor Fleming]], who went on to direct ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'', and [[Marshall Neilan]], who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a career spanning almost is long career spanning 50 years, Dwan directed over 400&amp;nbsp;motion pictures, many of them highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office smash, ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. He directed his last movie in 1961. {{cn|date=June 2014}}

He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], [[Mission Hills, California]].

Allan Dwan has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6263 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

'''Bishkek''' (in [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]: Бишкéк), formerly '''Pishpek''' and '''Frunze''', is the capital and the largest city of the [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz Republic]].
Bishkek is also the administrative centre of [[Chuy Province]] which surrounds the city, even though the city itself is not part of the province but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.

According to the post-Soviet ideology, the name is thought to derive from a [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] word for a churn used to make fermented mare's milk ([[kumis]]), the Kyrgyz national drink, which is rather debatable.
Founded in 1825 as a [[Khokand]] fortress of &quot;Pishpek&quot; to control local caravan routes and to get tribute from Kyrgyz tribes, on 4 September 1860 the fortress was destroyed by Russian forces led by colonel Zimmermann, with approval of the Kyrgyz. 
In 1868 a Russian settlement was founded on the fortress's spot, adopting its original name - Pishpek, within the General Governorship of [[Russian Turkestan]] and its [[Semirechye Oblast]].

In 1925 the [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast]] was created in Russian Turkestan, promoting Pishpek as its capital. In 1926 the city was given the name ''Frunze'', after the [[Bolshevik]] military leader [[Mikhail Frunze]], who was born here. In 1936 the city of Frunze became the capital of the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] during the final stages of the [[national delimitation in the Soviet Union]].

In 1991, the Kyrgyz parliament changed the capital's name to Bishkek (without quorum though).

Bishkek is situated at about {{convert|800|m}} altitude just off the northern fringe of the [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too]] range, an extension of the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range, which rises up to {{convert|4855|m}} and provides a spectacular backdrop to the city. North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighbouring [[Kazakhstan]]. The [[Chui River]] drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the [[Turkestan-Siberia Railway]] by a [[spur line]].

Bishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous [[Khrushchyovka|Soviet-style]] apartment blocks surrounding interior courtyards and, especially outside the city centre, thousands of smaller privately built houses. It is laid out on a grid pattern, with most streets flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels that water the innumerable trees which provide shade in the hot summers.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Bishkek}}

===Kokhand Rule===

Originally a caravan rest stop (possibly founded by the [[Sogdians]]) on one of the branches of the [[Silk Road]] through the [[Tian Shan]] range, the location was fortified in 1825 by the [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] khan of [[Kokhand]] with a mud fort. In the last years of Kokhand rule the fortress was led by Atabek, the Datka.

===Tsarist Era===

In 1860, the fort was conquered and razed by the military forces of colonel Zimmermann when [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]] annexed the area. Colonel [[Zimmermann|Zimmerman]] rebuilt the town over the destroyed fort and put field poruchik Titov as a head of new Russian [http://militera.lib.ru/h/pishpek/02.html garrison]. The site was redeveloped from 1877 onward by the Russian government, which encouraged the settlement of Russian peasants by giving them fertile land to develop.

===Soviet Era===
[[File:Michael Frunze Statue vor dem Bahnhof von Bischkek.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Frunze statue near the railway station]]
In 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast|Kirghiz ASSR]] and was renamed &quot;Frunze&quot; after [[Mikhail Frunze]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] close associate who was born in Bishkek and played key roles during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|revolutions of 1905]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1917|1917]] and during the [[Russian civil war]] of the early 1920s.

===Independence Era===

The early 1990s were tumultuous. In June 1990, a state of emergency was declared following severe ethnic riots in southern Kyrgyzstan which threatened to spread to the capital. The city was renamed Bishkek on 5 February 1991 and Kyrgyzstan achieved independence later that year during the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|breakup of the Soviet Union]]. Before independence, the majority of Bishkek's population was ethnic [[Russian people|Russians]]. In 2004, Russians made up approximately 20% of the city's population, and about 7–8% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3681/is_200407/ai_n9472919 Residential Real Estate Market in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan: Current Conditions and Prospects]{{dead link|date=March 2012}} {{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Bishkek is a modern city, with many restaurants and cafes and with many second-hand European and Japanese cars and minibuses crowding its streets. Streets and sidewalks have fallen into disrepair since the 1990s. At the same time Bishkek still preserves its former Soviet feel, with Soviet-period buildings and gardens prevailing over newer structures.

Bishkek is also the country's financial centre, with all of the country's 21 commercial banks keeping headquarters in the city. During the Soviet era, the city was home to a large number of industrial plants, but most have been shut down since 1991 or operate today on a much reduced scale. One of Bishkek's largest employment centres today is [[Dordoy Bazaar|Dordoy Bazaar open market]], which is one of the major sale place of Chinese goods imported to [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries.

==Geography==

===Orientation===
Though the city is relatively young, the surrounding area has some sites of interest dating from prehistory, the [[Greco-Buddhist]] period, the period of [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] influence, the era of the Central Asian ''[[khanate]]s'', and the Soviet period.

The central part of the city is primarily built on a rectangular grid plan. The city's main street is the east–west Chui Avenue ([[Chuy Prospekti]]), named after the region's [[Chui River|main river]]. In the Soviet era, it was called [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] Avenue. Along, or within a block or two from it, many of the most important government buildings, universities, the [[Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] compound, and so on, are to be found. The westernmost section of the avenue is known as [[Deng Xiaoping]] Avenue.

The main north–south axis is [[Yusup Abdrakhmanov]] Street, still commonly referred to by its old name, ''Sovietskaya Street''. Its northern and southern sections are called, respectively, Yelebesov and Baityk Batyr Streets. Several major shopping centres are located along it, and in the north it provides access to [[Dordoy Bazaar]].

Erkindik (&quot;Freedom&quot;) Boulevard runs from north to south, from the main railroad station (Bishkek II) south of Chui Avenue to the museum quarter and sculpture park just north of Chui Avenue, and further north toward the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past, it was called Dzerzhinsky Boulevard—named after a Communist revolutionary, [[Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky|Felix Dzerzhinsky]]—and its northern continuation is still called Dzerzhinsky Street.

An important east–west street is Jibek Jolu ('[[Silk Road]]'). It runs parallel to Chui Avenue about a mile north of it, and is part of the main east–west road of [[Chui Province]]. Both the Eastern and Western bus terminals are located along Jibek Jolu.

There is a Roman Catholic church located at ul. Vasiljeva 197 (near Rynok Bayat). This is the only Catholic Cathedral in Kyrgyzstan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-kyrgyzstan.org/ Catholic Church in Kyrgyzstan]. Catholic-kyrgyzstan.org. Retrieved 11 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===City centre===
[[File:Bishkek square.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ala-Too Square]], {{nowrap|Bishkek's main square}}]]
* State Historical Museum, located in [[Ala-Too Square]], the main city square
* State Museum of Applied Arts, containing examples of Kyrgyz traditional [[handicraft]]s
* Frunze House Museum
* Statue of [[Ivan Panfilov]] stands in the park near the [[White House (Bishkek)|White House]].
* An [[equestrian statue]] of [[Mikhail Frunze]] still stands in a large park (Boulevard Erkindik) across from the train station.
* The train station itself was built in 1946 by German prisoners of war and has survived since then without further renovation or repairs; most of those who built it perished and were buried in unmarked pits near the station.
* The main government building, the [[White House (Bishkek)|White House]], is a huge, seven story marble block and the former headquarters of the Communist Party of the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz SSR]]
* At Ala-Too Square, there is an Independence monument where the changing of the guards may be watched.
* [[Osh bazaar]], west of the downtown area, is a large, picturesque produce market

===Outer neighbourhoods===
The [[Dordoy Bazaar]], just inside the bypass highway on the north-eastern edge of the city, is a major retail and wholesale market.

===Outside the city===
The [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too]] mountain range, some {{convert|40|km}} away, provides a spectacular backdrop to the city; the [[Ala Archa National Park]] is only a 30 to 45 minutes drive away.

===Climate===
Bishkek has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfa/Dwa/Dsa: Hot (or very warm) summer subtype|Dsa]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Asia_Koppen_Map.png |title=Koppen Map |publisher=Upload.wikimedia.org |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; averaging 322 clear days annually due to its mountainous location. Average [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is around {{convert|440|mm}} per year. Average daily high temperatures range from {{convert|-3|°C|1}} in January to about {{convert|31|°C|1}} during July.&lt;ref name = Pogoda /&gt; The summer months are dominated by dry periods experiencing the occasional [[thunderstorm]] which produces strong gusty winds and rare [[dust storm]]s. The mountains to the south provide a natural boundary to provide protection from much of the damaging weather along with the smaller chain which runs NW to SE. In the winter months, sparse [[Winter storm|snow storms]] and frequent heavy [[fog]] are the dominating features. When an inversion sets up, the fog can last for days at a time.

==Ecology and environment==

===Air quality===
Emissions of air pollutants in Bishkek amounted to 14,400 tons in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteo.ktnet.kg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.kg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=11&amp;lang=ru |title=Анализ загрязнения атмосферы |publisher=Nature.kg |date= |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all other cities of Kyrgyzstan, the level of air pollution in Bishkek is the highest with occasional exceeding maximum allowable concentrations by several times, especially in the city's center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.kg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=11&amp;lang=ru Web-site of the State Agency on Environment Protection and Forestry: Assessment of Air Pollution]. Meteo.ktnet.kg. Retrieved on 11 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, occasionally formaldehyde concentrations exceed maximum allowable ones by four times.

Responsibility for ambient air quality monitoring in Bishkek lies on Kyrgyz State Agency on Hydrometeorology. In total, there are seven air quality monitoring stations in Bishkek, measuring levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, and ammonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteo.ktnet.kg&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:E7919-Dordoy-Bazaar-clothing.jpg|thumb|[[Dordoy Bazaar]]]]
Bishkek uses the Kyrgyzstan currency, the [[Kyrgyzstani som|som]]. The Som's value fluctuates regularly, but averages around 47 som per U.S. Dollar as of March 2011. The economy in Bishkek is primarily agricultural with the mass amounts of fruits,  vegetables and livestock providing a co-existing system of bartering in the outlying regions. The streets of Bishkek are regularly lined with produce vendors in a market style venue. In the major portions of downtown there is a more urban cityscape with banks, stores, markets and malls. The most sought after of the goods are the prevalent hand-crafted artisan pieces; these include statues, carvings, paintings and many nature based sculptures.

==Government==
Local government is administered by the Bishkek Mayor's Office.  [[Askarbek Salymbekov]] was mayor until his resignation in August 2005, following which his deputy [[Arstanbek Nogoev]] took over the mayorship. Nogoev was in turn removed from his position in October 2007 through a decree of President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] and replaced by businessman and former first deputy prime minister [[Daniar Usenov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=182916&amp;Itemid=7|publisher=The Times of Central Asia|title=New mayor of Bishkek promises to solve capital’s problems|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=18 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024001610/http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=182916&amp;Itemid=7 |archivedate = 24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503|journal=Eurasia Daily Monitor|publisher=The Jamestown Foundation|volume=4|issue=190|last=Marat|first=Erica|title=Upcoming referendum sinks Kyrgyzstan deeper into crisis|date=15 October 2007|accessdate=18 October 2007  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071022122621/http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503 |archivedate = 22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kyrgyz capital gets new mayor|url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2005/05-08-22.rferl.html#20|publisher=Radio Free Europe|date=22 August 2005|accessdate=18 October 2007|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKgVssqi |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008 former head of the Kyrgyz Railways [[Nariman Tuleyev]] was appointed mayor, who was dismissed by the interim government after 7 April 2010.

===Mass public transport===
There is public transportation available, including buses, electric [[trolley bus]]es, and public vans (known in Russian as ''[[marshrutka]]''). The first bus and trolley bus services in Bishkek were introduced in 1934 and 1951 correspondingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Frunze. City Encyclopedia.  | publisher = | date = | url = http://yiv1999.narod.ru/ABC_0040.htm#6300| accessdate = 2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxi cabs can be found throughout the city.

There is no subway in Bishkek, but the city is considering designing and building a light rail system ([[:ru:Бишкекское лёгкое метро|Бишкекское лёгкое метро]]).

===Commuter and long-distance buses===
There are two main bus stations in Bishkek. The smaller old Eastern Bus Station is primarily the terminal for minibuses to various destinations within or just beyond the eastern suburbs, such as [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]], [[Tokmok]], [[Kemin]], [[Issyk Ata]], or the [[Korday]] border crossing.

Long-distance regular bus and minibus services to all parts of the country, as well as to [[Almaty]] (the largest city in neighboring [[Kazakhstan]]) and [[Kashgar]], China, run mostly from the newer grand Western Bus Station; only a smaller minority of them runs from the Eastern Station.

The Dordoy Bazaar on the north-eastern outskirts of the city also contains makeshift terminals for frequent minibuses to suburban towns in all directions (from [[Sokuluk]] in the west to [[Tokmok|Tokmak]] in the east) and to some buses taking traders to Kazakhstan and Siberia.

===Rail===
As of 2007, the Bishkek railway station sees only a few trains a day. It offers a popular three-day train service from Bishkek to Moscow.

There are also long-distance trains that leave for Siberia ([[Novosibirsk]] and [[Novokuznetsk]]), via [[Almaty]], over the [[Turksib]] route, and to [[Yekaterinburg]] (Sverdlovsk) in the Urals, via [[Astana]]. These services are remarkably slow (over 48 hours to Yekaterinburg), due to long stops at the border and the indirect route (the trains first have to go west for more than a {{convert|100|km}} before they enter the main [[Turksib]] line and can continue to the east or north). For example, as of the fall of 2008, train No. 305 Bishkek-Yekaterinburg was scheduled to take 11 hours to reach the [[Shu, Kazakhstan|Shu]] junction—a distance of some {{convert|269|km}} by rail, and less than half of that by road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poezda.net/ru/train_timetable?st_code=2708000&amp;order=&amp;forDate=3 |title=Маршрут поезда ????? - ????? на сайте |publisher=Poezda.net |date= |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
The city is served by [[Manas International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] code FRU), located approximately {{convert|25|km}} northwest of the city centre, and readily reachable by taxi.

In 2002, the United States obtained the right to use Manas International Airport as an [[Manas Air Base|air base]] for its military operations in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. Russia subsequently (2003) established an air base of its own ([[Kant (air base)|Kant Air Base]]) near [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]] some {{convert|20|km}} east of Bishkek. It is based at a facility that used to be home to a major Soviet military pilot training school; one of its students, [[Hosni Mubarak]], later became president of [[Egypt]].

The '''British Empire''' comprised the [[dominion]]s, [[Crown colony|colonies]], [[protectorate]]s, [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]] and other [[Dependent territory|territories]] ruled or administered by the United Kingdom. It originated with the [[English overseas possessions|overseas possessions]] and [[trading post]]s established by [[Kingdom of England|England]] between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the [[List of largest empires|largest]] empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost [[Power (international relations)#Categories of Power|global power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Niall |year=2004 |title=Empire, The rise and demise of the British world order and the lessons for global power |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-02328-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1922 the British Empire held sway over about 458 million people, one-fifth of the world's population at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMaddison2001|Maddison 2001]], pp.&amp;nbsp;98, 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The empire covered more than {{convert|33700000|km2|sqmi|-3|abbr=on}}, almost a quarter of the Earth's total land area.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFerguson2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refElkins2005|Elkins2005]], p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, its political, [[Common law|legal]], [[English language|linguistic]] and [[Culture of the United Kingdom|cultural]] legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase &quot;[[the empire on which the sun never sets]]&quot; was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.

During the [[Age of Discovery]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] pioneered European exploration of the globe, and in the process established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires generated, England, [[French colonial empire|France]], and the [[Dutch Empire|Netherlands]] began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England (and then, following [[Acts of Union 1707|union between England and Scotland]] in 1707, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]) the dominant [[Colonialism|colonial power]] in North America and India.

The independence of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in North America in 1783 after the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies. British attention soon turned towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. Following the defeat of [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] in 1815, Britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe. Increasing degrees of autonomy were granted to its [[White people|white]] [[Settler colonialism|settler colonies]], some of which were reclassified as [[dominion]]s.

By the start of the twentieth century, [[German Empire|Germany]] and the United States had eroded some of Britain's economic lead. Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the [[First World War]], during which Britain relied heavily upon its empire. The conflict placed enormous financial and population strain on Britain.  Although the empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after World War I, Britain was no longer a peerless industrial or military power. In the [[Second World War]], Britain's colonies in [[Southeast Asia|South-East Asia]] were occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Despite the eventual victory of Britain and its allies, this damaged British prestige and accelerated the decline of the empire.
[[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]], Britain's most valuable and populous possession, achieved independence as part of a larger [[decolonisation]] movement in which Britain also granted independence to most of the territories of the British Empire. The [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|political transfer]] of Hong Kong to China in 1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brendon-Empire-end&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prince-Charles-Empire-End&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;refohbev594&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Empire-End&quot;/&gt; Fourteen [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territories]] remain under British sovereignty. After independence, many former British colonies joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a free association of independent states. Sixteen Commonwealth nations share their [[head of state]], Queen [[Elizabeth II]], as [[Commonwealth realm]]s.

== Origins (1497–1583) ==
[[File:Matthew-BristolHarbour-Aug2004.jpg|thumb|upright|A replica of ''The Matthew'', [[John Cabot]]'s ship used for his second voyage to the [[New World]]]]

The foundations of the British Empire were laid when [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] were separate kingdoms. In 1496 King [[Henry VII of England]], following the successes of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] in overseas exploration, commissioned [[John Cabot]] to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ferguson3&quot;&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Cabot sailed in 1497, five years after the [[European discovery of America]], and although he successfully made landfall on the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (mistakenly believing, like [[Christopher Columbus]], that he had reached Asia),&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews 1985]], p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt; there was no attempt to found a colony. Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year but nothing was heard of his ships again.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;

No further attempts to establish English colonies in the Americas were made until well into the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], during the last decades of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] had made enemies of England and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferguson3&quot;/&gt; In 1562, the [[List of English monarchs|English Crown]] sanctioned the [[privateer]]s [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] and [[Francis Drake]] to engage in slave-raiding attacks against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of West Africa&lt;ref&gt;[[#refThomas|Thomas]], pp.&amp;nbsp;155–158&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of breaking into the Atlantic trade system. This effort was rebuffed and later, as the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish Wars]] intensified, Elizabeth lent her blessing to further privateering against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic, laden with treasure from the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, influential writers such as [[Richard Hakluyt]] and [[John Dee]] (who was the first to use the term &quot;British Empire&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt; were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own empire. By this time, Spain had become the dominant power in the Americas and was exploring the Pacific, Portugal had established trading posts and forts from the coasts of Africa and [[Brazil]] to China, and [[French colonial empire|France]] had begun to settle the [[Saint Lawrence River]], later to become [[New France]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;4–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plantations of Ireland ===
Although England trailed behind other European powers in establishing overseas colonies, it had been engaged during the 16th century in the settlement of Ireland with Protestants from England and Scotland, drawing on precedents dating back to the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKenny|Kenny]], p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; Several people who helped establish the [[Plantations of Ireland]] also played a part in the early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the [[West Country men]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTaylor2001|Taylor]], pp.&amp;nbsp;119,123.&lt;/ref&gt;

== First British Empire (1583–1783) ==
{{Main|English overseas possessions}}

In 1578, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] granted a patent to [[Humphrey Gilbert]] for discovery and overseas exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews]], p.&amp;nbsp;187.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Gilbert sailed for the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] with the intention of engaging in piracy and establishing a colony in North America, but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews]], p.&amp;nbsp;188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1583 he embarked on a second attempt, on this occasion to the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] whose harbour he formally claimed for England, although no settlers were left behind. Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England, and was succeeded by his half-brother, [[Walter Raleigh]], who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584. Later that year, Raleigh founded the colony of [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] on the coast of present-day [[North Carolina]], but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], pp.&amp;nbsp;63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603, [[James VI and I|James VI, King of Scots]] ascended to the English throne and in 1604 negotiated the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]], ending hostilities with [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. Now at peace with its main rival, English attention shifted from preying on other nations' colonial infrastructure to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;70.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Empire began to take shape during the early 17th century, with the [[British colonization of the Americas|English settlement]] of North America and the smaller islands of the [[Caribbean]], and the establishment of [[Privately held company|private companies]], most notably the [[East India Company|English East India Company]], to administer colonies and overseas trade. This period, until the loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] after the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] towards the end of the 18th century, has subsequently been referred to as the &quot;First British Empire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Americas, Africa and the slave trade ===
{{Main|British colonization of the Americas|British America|Thirteen Colonies}}

The [[Caribbean]] initially provided England's most important and lucrative colonies,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; but not before several attempts at colonisation failed. An attempt to establish a colony in [[British Guiana|Guiana]] in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonies in [[Saint Lucia|St Lucia]]&amp;nbsp;(1605) and [[Grenada]]&amp;nbsp;(1609) also rapidly folded, but settlements were successfully established in [[Saint Kitts|St. Kitts]]&amp;nbsp;(1624), [[Barbados]]&amp;nbsp;(1627) and [[Nevis]]&amp;nbsp;(1628).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;221.&lt;/ref&gt; The colonies soon adopted the system of [[Plantation|sugar plantations]] successfully used by the Portuguese in [[Brazil]], which depended on [[Slavery|slave labour]], and—at first—Dutch ships, to sell the [[Slavery|slaves]] and buy the sugar.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament [[Navigation Acts|decreed]] in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the [[Dutch Republic|United Dutch Provinces]]—a series of [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1655, England annexed the island of [[Jamaica]] from the Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;33, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.PNG|thumb|left|Map of British colonies in North America, 1763–1776]]
England's first permanent settlement in the Americas was founded in 1607 in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], led by Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] and managed by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]]. [[Bermuda]] was settled and claimed by England as a result of the 1609 shipwreck there of the Virginia Company's [[Sea Venture|flagship]], and in 1615 was turned over to the newly formed [[Somers Isles Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;15–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Virginia Company's charter was revoked in 1624 and direct control of Virginia was assumed by the [[Crown colony|crown]], thereby founding the [[Colony of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews]], pp.&amp;nbsp;316, 324–326.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[London and Bristol Company]] was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland, but was largely unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews]], pp.&amp;nbsp;20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1620, [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] was founded as a haven for [[puritan]] religious separatists, later known as the [[Pilgrim]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; Fleeing from [[religious persecution]] would become the motive of many English would-be colonists to risk the arduous [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic voyage]]: [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]] was founded as a haven for [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]&amp;nbsp;(1634), [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]]&amp;nbsp;(1636) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut&amp;nbsp;(1639) for [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]]. The [[Province of Carolina]] was founded in 1663. With the surrender of [[Fort Amsterdam]] in 1664, England gained control of the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]], renaming it New York. This was formalised in negotiations following the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|Second Anglo-Dutch War]], in exchange for [[Suriname]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1681, the colony of [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] was founded by [[William Penn]]. The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean, but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], pp.&amp;nbsp;72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Insert some discussion of interaction with Native Indians here --&gt;
[[File:Tobacco cultivation (Virginia, ca. 1670).jpg|thumb|African slaves working in 17th-century [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], by an unknown artist, 1670]]
In 1670, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] incorporated by [[royal charter]] the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC), granting it a monopoly on the [[fur trade]] in the area known as [[Rupert's Land]], which would later form a large proportion of the [[Canada|Dominion of Canada]].  Forts and trading posts established by the HBC were frequently the subject of attacks by the French, who had established their own fur trading colony in adjacent [[New France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;buckner25&quot;&gt;[[British Empire#refBuckner2008|Buckner]], p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, the [[Royal African Company]] was inaugurated, receiving from King Charles a monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt; From the outset, [[slavery]] was the basis of the British Empire in the West Indies. Until the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves transported across the Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of West Africa, such as [[James Island (The Gambia)|James Island]], [[Jamestown, Ghana|Accra]] and [[Bunce Island]]. In the British [[Caribbean]], the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25 percent in 1650 to around 80 percent in 1780, and in the 13 Colonies from 10 percent to 40 percent over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;228.&lt;/ref&gt; For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western [[City status in the United Kingdom|British cities]] as [[Bristol]] and [[Liverpool]], which formed the third corner of the so-called [[triangular trade]] with Africa and the Americas. For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average [[mortality rate]] during the [[Middle Passage]] was one in seven.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv2|Marshall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;440–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1695, the [[Scottish Parliament]] granted a charter to the [[Company of Scotland]], which established a settlement in 1698 on the [[isthmus of Panama]]. Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]], and afflicted by [[malaria]], the colony was abandoned two years later. The [[Darien scheme]] was a financial disaster for Scotland—a quarter of Scottish capital&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMagnusson2003|Magnusson]], p.&amp;nbsp;531.&lt;/ref&gt; was lost in the enterprise—and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire. The episode also had major political consequences, persuading the governments of both England and Scotland of the merits of a union of countries, rather than just crowns.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMacaulay1979|Macaulay]], p.&amp;nbsp;509.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred in 1707 with the [[Treaty of Union]], establishing the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].

=== Rivalry with the Netherlands in Asia ===
[[File:Fort St. George, Chennai.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Fort St. George (India)|Fort St. George]] was founded at [[Chennai|Madras]] in 1639.]]

At the end of the 16th century, England and the Netherlands began to challenge Portugal's monopoly of trade with Asia, forming private [[Joint stock company|joint-stock companies]] to finance the voyages—the English, later British, [[East India Company]] and the [[Dutch East India Company]], chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative [[spice trade]], an effort focused mainly on two regions; the [[Malay Archipelago|East Indies archipelago]], and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt; Although England would ultimately eclipse the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system&lt;ref name=&quot;ferguson19&quot;&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt; and the three [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 when the Dutch [[William III of England|William of Orange]] ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferguson19&quot;/&gt;

=== Global conflicts with France ===
[[File:The Defeat of the French Fireships attacking the British Fleet at Anchor before Quebec.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Defeat of French [[fireship]]s at [[Quebec]] in 1759]]
Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the [[Nine Years' War]] as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their [[military budget]] on the costly land war in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;441.&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th century would see England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPagden2003|Pagden]], p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of [[Charles II of Spain]] in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]], a grandson of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]], raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;shennan11&quot;/&gt; In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] against Spain and France in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which lasted until 1714.

At the concluding [[Treaty of Utrecht]], Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;shennan11&quot;&gt;[[#refShennan1995|Shennan]], pp.&amp;nbsp;11–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and [[Acadia]], and from Spain, [[Gibraltar]] and [[Minorca]]. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative ''[[asiento]]'' (permission to sell slaves in [[Ibero-America|Spanish America]]) to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;58.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clive.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Robert Clive]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] established the [[East India Company|Company]] as a military as well as a commercial power.]]
During the middle decades of the 18th century, there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Carnatic Wars]], as the [[East India Company|English East India Company]] (the Company) and its French counterpart, the ''[[French East India Company|Compagnie française des Indes orientales]]'', struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]]. The [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, in which the British, led by [[Robert Clive]], defeated the [[Nawab of Bengal]] and his French allies, left the Company in control of [[Bengal]] and as the major military and political power in India.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; France was left control of its [[French India|enclaves]] but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSekhara2004|Bandyopādhyāẏa]], pp.&amp;nbsp;49–52&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decades the Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the [[British Indian Army]], the vast majority of which was composed of Indian [[sepoy]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British and French struggles in India became but one theatre of the global [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763) involving France, Britain and the other major European powers. The signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] had important consequences for the future of the British Empire. In North America, France's future as a colonial power there was effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to [[Rupert's Land]],&lt;ref name=&quot;buckner25&quot;/&gt; and the ceding of [[New France]] to Britain (leaving a sizeable [[French Canadian|French-speaking population]] under British control) and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] to Spain. Spain ceded Florida to Britain. Along with its victory over France in India, the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's most powerful maritime power.&lt;ref name=&quot;refpagden1&quot;&gt;[[#refPagden2003|Pagden]], p.&amp;nbsp;91.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rise of the Second British Empire (1783–1815) ==

=== Loss of the Thirteen American Colonies ===
{{Main|American Revolution}}

During the 1760s and early 1770s, relations between the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily due to resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;84.&lt;/ref&gt; This was summarised at the time by the slogan &quot;[[No taxation without representation]]&quot;, a perceived violation of the guaranteed [[Rights of Englishmen]]. The [[American Revolution]] began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government.  In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of [[American Revolutionary War|war]] in 1775.  The following year, in 1776, the [[United States Declaration of Independence|United States declared independence]].  The entry of [[France in the American Revolutionary War|France]] to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms.  American independence was acknowledged at the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;312–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|left|''Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown''. The loss of the American colonies marked the end of the &quot;first British Empire&quot;.]]
The loss of such a large portion of [[British America]], at the time Britain's most populous overseas possession, is seen by historians as the event defining the transition between the &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second&quot; empires,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Britain shifted its attention away from the Americas to Asia, the Pacific and later Africa. [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that [[free trade]] should replace the old [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the [[protectionism]] of Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;refpagden1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783 seemed to confirm Smith's view that political control was not necessary for economic success.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv2|Marshall]], p.&amp;nbsp;585.&lt;/ref&gt;

Events in America influenced British policy in Canada, where between 40,000 and 100,000&lt;ref&gt;[[#refZolberg2006|Zolberg]], p.&amp;nbsp;496.&lt;/ref&gt; defeated [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] had migrated from America following independence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGames2002|Games]], pp.&amp;nbsp;46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The 14,000 Loyalists who went to the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John]] and [[Saint Croix River (Maine – New Brunswick)|Saint Croix]] river valleys, then part of [[Nova Scotia]], felt too far removed from the provincial government in Halifax, so London split off [[New Brunswick]] as a separate colony in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKelley2010|Kelley &amp; Trebilcock]], p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitutional Act of 1791]] created the provinces of [[Upper Canada]] (mainly English-speaking) and [[Lower Canada]] (mainly [[French language|French-speaking]]) to defuse tensions between the French and British communities, and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain, with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions between Britain and the United States escalated again during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], as Britain tried to cut off American trade with France and boarded American ships to [[Impressment|impress]] into the Royal Navy men of British birth. The US declared war, the [[War of 1812]], and invaded Canadian territory, but the pre-war boundaries were reaffirmed by the 1814 [[Treaty of Ghent]], ensuring Canada's future would be separate from that of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLatimer|Latimer]], pp.&amp;nbsp;8, 30–34, 389–92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv2|Marshall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;388.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exploration of the Pacific ===
[[File:Captainjamescookportrait.jpg|thumb|160px|[[James Cook]]'s mission was to find the alleged southern continent ''[[Terra Australis]]''.]]

Since 1718, [[penal transportation|transportation]] to the American colonies had been a penalty for various criminal offences in Britain, with approximately one thousand convicts transported per year across the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt; Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the 13 Colonies in 1783, the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer [[Willem Janszoon|Willem Jansz]] in 1606 and was later named [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] by the [[Dutch East India Company]],&lt;ref name&gt;[[#refMulligan2001|Mulligan &amp; Hill]], pp.&amp;nbsp;20–23.&lt;/ref&gt; but there was no attempt to colonise it. In 1770 [[James Cook]] discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific [[First voyage of James Cook|voyage]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific Ocean]], claimed the continent for Britain, and named it [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPeters2006|Peters]], pp.&amp;nbsp;5–23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1778, [[Joseph Banks]], Cook's [[Botany|botanist]] on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of [[Botany Bay]] for the establishment of a [[Penal colony|penal settlement]], and in 1787 the first shipment of [[Convicts in Australia|convicts]] set sail, arriving in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;142.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#refBrittain|Britain and the Dominions]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;159.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFieldhouse1999|Fieldhouse]], pp. 145–149&lt;/ref&gt; mainly due to gold rushes in the colony of Victoria, making its capital [[Melbourne]] the richest city in the world&lt;ref name=&quot;RobertCervero320&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cervero|first=Robert B.|title=The Transit Metropolis: A Global Inquiry|publisher=Island Press|year=1998|location=Chicago|page=320|isbn=1-55963-591-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest city after London in the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Statesmen's Year Book 1889&lt;/ref&gt;

During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first discovered by Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] in 1642, and claimed the [[North Island|North]] and [[South Island|South]] islands for the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British crown]] in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, interaction between the indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]] population and Europeans was limited to the trading of goods. European settlement increased through the early decades of the 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the [[New Zealand Company]] announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain [[William Hobson]] and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This treaty is considered by many to be New Zealand's founding document,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day|title=Waitangi Day|publisher=History Group, New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;579.&lt;/ref&gt; have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMeinSmith|Mein Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War with Napoleonic France ===
{{Main|Napoleonic Wars}}

Britain was challenged again by France under [[Napoleon]], in a struggle that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;152.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not only Britain's position on the world stage that was threatened: Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself, just as his armies had overrun many countries of [[continental Europe]].

[[File:Battle of Waterloo 1815.PNG|thumb|The [[Battle of Waterloo]] ended in the defeat of [[Napoleon]].]]
The Napoleonic Wars were therefore ones in which Britain invested large amounts of capital and resources to win. French ports were blockaded by the [[Royal Navy]], which won a decisive victory over a Franco-Spanish fleet at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] in 1805. Overseas colonies were attacked and occupied, including those of the Netherlands, which was annexed by Napoleon in 1810. France was finally defeated by a coalition of European armies in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;115–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain was again the beneficiary of peace treaties: France ceded the [[United States of the Ionian Islands|Ionian Islands]], [[Malta Protectorate|Malta]] (which it had occupied in 1797 and 1798 respectively), [[Mauritius]], [[Saint Lucia|St Lucia]], and [[Tobago]]; Spain ceded [[Trinidad]]; the Netherlands [[British Guiana|Guyana]], and the [[Cape Colony]]. Britain returned [[Guadeloupe]], Martinique, [[French Guiana]], and [[Réunion]] to France, and [[Java]] and [[Suriname]] to the Netherlands, while gaining control of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] (1795–1815).&lt;ref name=&quot;refjames182&quot;&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Aruba and Curaçao were returned as well I think--&gt;

=== Abolition of slavery ===

Under increasing pressure from the British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] movement, the British government enacted the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] in 1807 which abolished the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] in the empire. In 1808, [[Sierra Leone]] was designated an official British colony for freed slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act]] passed in 1833 abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834 (with the exception of [[St. Helena]], Ceylon and the territories administered by the East India Company, though these exclusions were later repealed). Under the Act, slaves were granted full [[emancipation]] after a period of 4 to 6 years of &quot;apprenticeship&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHinks|Hinks]], p.&amp;nbsp;129.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Imperial Federation, Map of the World Showing the Extent of the British Empire in 1886 (levelled).jpg|thumb|250px|An elaborate map of the British Empire in 1886, marked in the traditional colour for imperial British dominions on maps]]

Between 1815 and 1914, a period referred to as Britain's &quot;imperial century&quot; by some historians,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHyam2002|Hyam]], p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt; around {{convert|10000000|sqmi|km2}} of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refParsons|Parsons]], p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than [[The Great Game|Russia in central Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;#refOHBEv3|Porter, p. 401&quot;&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;401.&lt;/ref&gt; Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;332.&lt;/ref&gt; and a foreign policy of &quot;[[splendid isolation]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLee1994|Lee 1994]], pp.&amp;nbsp;254–257.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries, such as China, [[Argentina]] and [[Thailand|Siam]], which has been characterised by some historians as &quot;[[Informal Empire]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;156–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

British imperial strength was underpinned by the [[Steamboat|steamship]] and the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, the so-called [[All Red Line]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDalziel2006|Dalziel]], pp.&amp;nbsp;88–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== East India Company in Asia ===
{{See also|British Raj}}
[[File:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|right|thumb|upright|An 1876 political cartoon of [[Benjamin Disraeli]] (1804–1881) making [[Queen Victoria]] [[Emperor of India|Empress of India]]. The caption was &quot;New crowns for old ones!&quot;]]
The [[East India Company]] drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The Company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to co-operate in arenas outside India: the eviction of Napoleon from [[Egypt]] (1799), the capture of [[Java]] from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of [[Singapore]] (1819) and [[Malacca]] (1824) and the defeat of [[Burma]] (1826).&lt;ref name=&quot;#refOHBEv3|Porter, p. 401&quot;/&gt;

From its base in India, the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable [[opium]] export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMartin2007|Martin]], pp.&amp;nbsp;146–148.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the [[First Opium War]], and resulted in the seizure by Britain of [[Hong Kong Island]], at that time a minor settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJanin1999|Janin]], p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 18th and early 19th centuries the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the Company. A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the [[Regulating Act of 1773]], [[Pitt's India Act]] of 1784 and the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKeay|Keay]], p.&amp;nbsp;393&lt;/ref&gt; The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Rebellion]], a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of [[sepoy]]s, Indian troops under British officers and discipline.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refParsons|Parsons]], pp.&amp;nbsp;44–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the [[Government of India Act 1858]], establishing the [[British Raj]], where an appointed [[Governor-General of India|governor-general]] administered India and [[Queen Victoria]] was crowned the Empress of India.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], pp. 50–57.&lt;/ref&gt; India became the empire's most valuable possession, &quot;the Jewel in the Crown&quot;, and was the most important source of Britain's strength.&lt;ref name=Brown5&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of serious crop failures in the late 19th century led to [[Famine in India|widespread famines]] on the subcontinent in which it is estimated that over 15 million people died. The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule. Later, under direct British rule, commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to have an effect.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;133–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rivalry with Russia ===
{{Main|The Great Game}}
[[File:Relief of the Light Brigade.png|thumb|British cavalry charging against Russian forces at [[Battle of Balaclava|Balaclava]] in 1854]]
During the 19th century, Britain and the [[Russian Empire]] vied to fill the power vacuums that had been left by the declining [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Qajar dynasty]] and [[Qing Dynasty]]. This rivalry in Eurasia came to be known as the &quot;[[The Great Game|Great Game]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHopkirk1992|Hopkirk]], pp.&amp;nbsp;1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; As far as Britain was concerned, defeats inflicted by Russia on [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Persia]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Turkey]] demonstrated its imperial ambitions and capabilities and stoked fears in Britain of an overland invasion of India.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;181.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, Britain moved to pre-empt this by invading [[Afghanistan]], but the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] was a disaster for Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;refjames182&quot;&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;182.&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Russia invaded the Turkish [[Balkans]] in 1853, fears of Russian dominance in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the [[Crimean Peninsula]] to destroy Russian naval capabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;refjames182&quot;/&gt; The ensuing [[Crimean War|Crimean War (1854–56)]], which involved new techniques of [[modern warfare]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRoyle2000|Royle]], preface.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the only [[World war|global war]] fought between Britain and another [[Imperialism|imperial power]] during the ''Pax Britannica'', was a resounding defeat for Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;refjames182&quot;/&gt; The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioner's Province)|Baluchistan]] in 1876 and Russia annexing [[Kyrgyzstan|Kirghizia]], [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Turkmenistan]]. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]] in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Beryl J.|title=The Strategic Background to the Anglo-Russian Entente of August 1907|journal=The Historical Journal|year=1966|volume=9|pages=360–373 |jstor=2637986|doi=10.1017/S0018246X00026698|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of the [[Russian Navy]] by the Japanese at the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–05 also limited its threat to the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge47&quot;&gt;[[#refhodge47|Hodge]], p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cape to Cairo ===
[[File:Punch Rhodes Colossus.png|thumb|''[[The Rhodes Colossus]]''—[[Cecil Rhodes]] spanning &quot;Cape to Cairo&quot;]]

The Dutch East India Company had founded the [[Cape Colony]] on the southern tip of Africa in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the [[Indies|East Indies]]. Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large [[Afrikaner]] (or [[Boer]]) population in 1806, having occupied it in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands, following the invasion of the Netherlands by France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;85.&lt;/ref&gt; British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of Boers, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own—mostly short-lived—independent republics, during the [[Great Trek]] of the late 1830s and early 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], pp.&amp;nbsp;85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; In the process the [[Voortrekkers]] clashed repeatedly with the British, who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and with several African polities, including those of the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nations. Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the [[South African Republic]] or Transvaal Republic (1852–77; 1881–1902) and the [[Orange Free State]] (1854–1902).&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;168, 186, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902 Britain occupied both republics, concluding a treaty with the two [[Boer Republics]] following the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902).&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869 the [[Suez Canal]] opened under [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], linking the Mediterranean with the Indian Ocean. Initially the Canal was opposed by the British;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTilby2009|Tilby]], p.&amp;nbsp;256.&lt;/ref&gt; but once opened, its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the &quot;jugular vein of the Empire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRoger1986|Roger 1986]], p.&amp;nbsp;718.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Benjamin Disraeli]] bought the indebted Egyptian ruler [[Isma'il Pasha]]'s 44 percent shareholding in the Suez Canal for £4 million (£{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|4000000|1875|r=-7}}}} in 2013). Although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway, it did give Britain leverage. Joint Anglo-French financial control over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], pp.&amp;nbsp;230–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The French were still majority shareholders and attempted to weaken the British position,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;274.&lt;/ref&gt; but a compromise was reached with the 1888 [[Convention of Constantinople]], which made the Canal officially neutral territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaties|url=http://www.mfa.gov.eg/MFA_Portal/en-GB/Foreign_Policy/Treaties/Convention+Respecting+the+Free+Navigation+of+the+Suez+Maritime+Canal.htm|publisher=Egypt Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=20 October 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100915095412/http://www.mfa.gov.eg/MFA_Portal/en-GB/Foreign_Policy/Treaties/CONVENTION+RESPECTING+THE+FREE+NAVIGATION+OF+THE+SUEZ+MARITIME+CANAL.htm &lt;!-- Added by H3llBot --&gt;|archivedate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With French, [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] activity in the lower [[Congo River]] region undermining orderly incursion of tropical Africa, the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–85 was held to regulate the competition between the European powers in what was called the &quot;[[Scramble for Africa]]&quot; by defining &quot;effective occupation&quot; as the criterion for international recognition of territorial claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHerbst2000|Herbst]], pp.&amp;nbsp;71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; The scramble continued into the 1890s, and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in 1885 to withdraw from [[Sudan]]. A joint force of British and Egyptian troops defeated the [[Mahdist War|Mahdist Army]] in 1896, and rebuffed a French attempted invasion at [[Fashoda Incident|Fashoda]] in 1898. Sudan was nominally made an [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian Condominium]], but a British colony in reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vandervort1998|Vandervort]], pp.&amp;nbsp;169–183.&lt;/ref&gt;

British gains in southern and East Africa prompted [[Cecil Rhodes]], pioneer of British expansion in Africa, to urge a &quot;[[Cape to Cairo Railway|Cape to Cairo]]&quot; railway linking the strategically important [[Suez Canal]] to the mineral-rich South.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;298.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1880s and 1890s, Rhodes, with his privately owned [[British South Africa Company]], [[company rule in Rhodesia|occupied and annexed]] territories subsequently named after him, [[Rhodesia (name)|Rhodesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;215.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changing status of the white colonies ===
[[File:Horses hauling timber Ontario.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Dominion of Canada|Canada]]'s major industry in terms of employment and value of the product was the [[Economic history of Canada#Timber|timber trade]]. Ontario c. 1900.]]

The path to independence for the white colonies of the British Empire began with the 1839 [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|Durham Report]], which proposed unification and self-government for [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]], as a solution to political unrest there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], pp.&amp;nbsp;28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; This began with the passing of the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]] in 1840, which created the [[Province of Canada]]. [[Responsible government]] was first granted to [[Nova Scotia]] in 1848, and was soon extended to the other British North American colonies. With the passage of the [[British North America Act, 1867]] by the [[British Parliament]], Upper and Lower Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were formed into the [[Dominion of Canada]], a confederation enjoying full self-government with the exception of [[international relations]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;187&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and New Zealand achieved similar levels of self-government after 1900, with the Australian colonies [[federation of Australia|federating in 1901]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;dominion status&quot; was officially introduced at the [[Imperial Conference|Colonial Conference of 1907]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rhodes5&quot;/&gt;

The last decades of the 19th century saw concerted [[political campaign]]s for Irish [[home rule]]. Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the [[Act of Union 1800]] after the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], and had suffered a severe [[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine]] between 1845 and 1852. Home rule was supported by the British [[Prime minister]], [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada's footsteps as a Dominion within the empire, but his 1886 [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Home Rule bill]] was defeated in Parliament. Although the bill, if passed, would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation,&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;213&lt;/ref&gt; many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or mark the beginning of the break-up of the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;James, p. 315&quot;&gt;[[#refJames|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;315.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Irish Government Bill 1893|second Home Rule bill]] was also defeated for similar reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;James, p. 315&quot;/&gt; A [[Home Rule Act 1914|third bill]] was passed by Parliament in 1914, but not implemented due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]] leading to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== World wars (1914–1945) ==

By the turn of the 20th century, fears had begun to grow in Britain that it would no longer be able to defend the [[metropole]] and the entirety of the empire while at the same time maintaining the policy of &quot;[[splendid isolation]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOBrien|O'Brien]], p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany was rapidly rising as a military and industrial power and was now seen as the most likely opponent in any future war. Recognising that it was overstretched in the Pacific&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;667.&lt;/ref&gt; and threatened at home by the [[Imperial German Navy]], Britain [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|formed an alliance]] with Japan in 1902 and with its old enemies [[Entente cordiale|France]] and [[Anglo-Russian Entente|Russia]] in 1904 and 1907, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;275.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First World War ===
{{Main|History of the United Kingdom during World War I}}
[[File:Australian 53rd Bn Fromelles 19 July 1916.jpg|thumb|190px|Soldiers of the [[Australian 5th Division]], waiting to attack during the [[Battle of Fromelles]], 19 July 1916]]

Britain's fears of war with Germany were realised in 1914 with the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa. In the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied [[German New Guinea]] and [[Samoa]] respectively.  Plans for a post-war division of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which had joined the war on Germany's side, were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916 [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]]. This agreement was not divulged to the [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif of Mecca]], who the British had been encouraging to launch an Arab revolt against their Ottoman rulers, giving the impression that Britain was supporting the creation of an independent Arab state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown494-495&quot;&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], pp.&amp;nbsp;494–495.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British declaration of war on Germany and its allies also committed the colonies and Dominions, which provided invaluable military, financial and material support. Over 2.5 million men served in the armies of the Dominions, as well as many thousands of volunteers from the [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The contributions of Australian and New Zealand troops during the 1915 [[Gallipoli Campaign]] against the Ottoman Empire had a great impact on the national consciousness at home, and marked a watershed in the transition of Australia and New Zealand from colonies to nations in their own right. The countries continue to commemorate this occasion on [[Anzac Day]]. Canadians viewed the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in a similar light.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;277.&lt;/ref&gt; The important contribution of the Dominions to the [[war effort]] was recognised in 1917 by the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] when he invited each of the Dominion Prime Ministers to join an [[Imperial War Cabinet]] to co-ordinate imperial policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;278.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the concluding [[Treaty of Versailles]] signed in 1919, the empire reached its greatest extent with the addition of {{convert|1800000|sqmi|km2}} and 13 million new subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;315.&lt;/ref&gt; The colonies of Germany and the [[Ottoman Empire]] were distributed to the Allied powers as [[League of Nations mandate]]s. Britain gained control of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine, Transjordan]], [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|Iraq]], parts of [[British Cameroons|Cameroon]] and [[Togo]], and [[Tanganyika]]. The Dominions themselves also acquired mandates of their own: the [[Union of South Africa]] gained South-West Africa (modern-day [[Namibia]]), Australia gained [[German New Guinea]], and New Zealand [[Samoa|Western Samoa]]. [[Nauru]] was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific Dominions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFox2008|Fox]], pp.&amp;nbsp;23–29, 35, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inter-war period &amp; Irish War of Independence ===

The changing world order that the war had brought about, in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers, and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland, caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoldstein|Goldstein]], p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt; Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]], where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;reflouis302&quot;&gt;[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;302.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;294.&lt;/ref&gt; as militaristic governments took hold in Japan and Germany helped in part by the [[Great Depression]], for it was feared that the empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;303.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the issue of the empire's security was a serious concern in Britain, at the same time the empire was vital to the British economy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLee1996|Lee 1996]], p.&amp;nbsp;305.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, the frustrations caused by delays to [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish home rule]] led members of [[Sinn Féin]], a pro-independence party that had won a majority of the Irish seats at Westminster in the [[Irish general election, 1918|1918 British general election]], to establish an [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Republic)|Irish assembly]] in Dublin, at which Irish independence was declared. The [[Irish Republican Army]] simultaneously began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the British administration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish War of Independence|Anglo-Irish War]] ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northern Ireland]], consisting of six of the 32 [[Counties of Ireland|Irish counties]] which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|Government of Ireland Act]], immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMagee|Magee]], p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ImperialConference.jpg|thumb|left|[[George V]] with the British and Dominion prime ministers at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]]]]
A similar struggle began in India when the [[Government of India Act 1919]] failed to satisfy demand for independence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;330.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the [[Ghadar Conspiracy]] ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the [[Rowlatt Act]]s. This led to tension,&lt;ref name=&quot;refjames416&quot;&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;416.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the [[Punjab region]], where repressive measures culminated in the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre|Amritsar Massacre]]. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the event, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion.&lt;ref name=&quot;refjames416&quot;/&gt; The subsequent [[Non-cooperation movement|Non-Co-Operation movement]] was called off in March 1922 following the [[Chauri Chaura incident]], and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Low|first=D.A.|title=The Government of India and the First Non-Cooperation Movement-—1920–1922|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|date=February 1966|volume=25|issue=2|pages=241–259|doi=10.2307/2051326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, Egypt, which had been declared a British [[protectorate]] at the outbreak of the First World War, was [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|granted formal independence]], though it continued to be a British [[client state]] until 1954. [[British Army|British troops]] remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the [[Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the [[Suez Canal]] zone. In return, Egypt was assisted to join the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;292.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|Iraq]], a British [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arab and Jewish communities.  The 1917 [[Balfour Declaration]], which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;271.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|revolted in 1936]].  As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of the Arab population in the Middle East as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine|Jewish insurgency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown494-495&quot;/&gt;

The ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the [[1923 Imperial Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]], p.&amp;nbsp;187.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the [[Chanak Crisis]] the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]], p.&amp;nbsp;186.&lt;/ref&gt; After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the [[1926 Imperial Conference]] issued the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]], declaring the Dominions to be &quot;autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another&quot; within a &quot;British [[Commonwealth of Nations]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;69.&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rhodes5&quot;&gt;[[#refRhodes2009|Rhodes, Wanna &amp; Weller]], pp.&amp;nbsp;5–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify [[Law of the United Kingdom|British laws]] and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTurpin2007|Turpin &amp; Tomkins]], p.&amp;nbsp;48.&lt;/ref&gt; Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;300.&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland distanced itself further from Britain with the introduction of a new [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]] in 1937, making it a republic in all but name.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKenny|Kenny]], p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second World War ===
{{Main|British Empire in World War II}}
[[File:El Alamein 1942 - British infantry.jpg|thumb|During the [[Second World War]], the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] was made up of units from many different countries in the British Empire and Commonwealth; it fought in [[North African campaign|North African]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian]] campaigns.]]

Britain's declaration of war against [[Nazi Germany]] in September 1939 included the [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]] and India but did not automatically commit the Dominions. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland and South Africa all soon declared war on Germany, but the [[Irish Free State]] chose to remain [[Irish neutrality|legally neutral]] throughout [[The Emergency (Ireland)|the war]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;313–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Battle of France|German occupation of France]] in 1940, Britain and the empire stood alone against Germany, until the entry of the [[Soviet Union]] to the war in 1941. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] successfully lobbied President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for [[military aid]] from the United States, but Roosevelt was not yet ready to ask [[United States Congress|Congress]] to commit the country to war.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refGilbert2005|Gilbert]], p.&amp;nbsp;234.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the [[Atlantic Charter]], which included the statement that &quot;the rights of all peoples to choose the [[form of government]] under which they live&quot; should be respected. This wording was ambiguous as to whether it referred to European countries invaded by Germany, or the peoples colonised by European nations, and would later be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;reflloyd316&quot;&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;513.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1941, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] launched, in quick succession, attacks on British [[Malayan Campaign|Malaya]], the United States naval base at [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGilbert2005|Gilbert]], p.&amp;nbsp;244.&lt;/ref&gt; but the manner in which the British rapidly surrendered irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;319.&lt;/ref&gt; Most damaging of all was the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;460.&lt;/ref&gt; The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States.  This resulted in the 1951 [[ANZUS|ANZUS Pact]] between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America.&lt;ref name=&quot;reflloyd316&quot;/&gt;

== Decolonisation and decline (1945–1997) ==
Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the [[Second World War]], the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAbernethy2000|Abernethy]], p.&amp;nbsp;146.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a [[Anglo-American loan|$US 4.33&amp;nbsp;billion loan]] (US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;331.&lt;/ref&gt; the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006.&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-2006-33&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4757181.stm|title=What's a little debt between friends?|publisher=BBC News|date=10 May 2006|accessdate=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing [[Cold War]] rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, however, American [[Anti-communism]] prevailed over [[anti-imperialism]], and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in check.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLevine|Levine]], p.&amp;nbsp;193.&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;[[Wind of Change (speech)|wind of change]]&quot; ultimately meant that the British Empire's days were numbered, and on the whole, Britain adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies once stable, non-Communist governments were available to transfer power to. This was in contrast to other European powers such as France and Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAbernethy2000|Abernethy]], p.&amp;nbsp;148.&lt;/ref&gt; which waged costly and ultimately unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact. Between 1945 and 1965, the number of people under British rule outside the UK itself fell from 700 million to five million, three million of whom were in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;330.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initial disengagement ===

The pro-decolonisation [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, elected at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]] and led by [[Clement Attlee]], moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;322.&lt;/ref&gt; India's two major political parties—the [[Indian National Congress]] and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate [[Islamic state]] for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing [[Civil disorder|civil unrest]] and the [[Royal Indian Navy mutiny|mutiny of]] the [[History of the Indian Navy|Royal Indian Navy]] during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]], hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt; The borders drawn by the British to broadly [[Partition of India|partition India]] into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;325.&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the [[British Raj]], and [[Sri Lanka]] gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and [[Sri Lanka]] became members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], while Burma chose not to join.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]], pp.&amp;nbsp;355–356.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Mandate of Palestine]], where an Arab majority lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British with a similar problem to that of India.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;327.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was complicated by large numbers of [[Jewish refugees]] seeking to be admitted to Palestine following the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], while Arabs were opposed to the creation of a Jewish state. Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;328.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] subsequently voted for a [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|plan to partition Palestine]] into a Jewish and an Arab state.

Following the defeat of Japan in the Second World War, anti-Japanese [[resistance movement]]s in Malaya turned their attention towards the British, who had moved to quickly retake control of the colony, valuing it as a source of rubber and tin.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;335.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the guerrillas were primarily Malayan-Chinese Communists meant that the British attempt to quell the uprising was supported by the Muslim Malay majority, on the understanding that once the insurgency had been quelled, independence would be granted.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The [[Malayan Emergency]], as it was called, began in 1948 and lasted until 1960, but by 1957, Britain felt confident enough to grant independence to the [[Federation of Malaya]] within the Commonwealth. In 1963, the 11 states of the federation together with Singapore, Sarawak and [[North Borneo]] joined to form [[Malaysia]], but in 1965 Chinese-majority Singapore was expelled from the union following tensions between the Malay and Chinese populations.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;364.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brunei]], which had been a British protectorate since 1888, declined to join the union&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;396.&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained its status until independence in 1984.

=== Suez and its aftermath ===
{{Main|Suez Crisis}}
[[File:Eden, Anthony.jpg|thumb|upright|left|British Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]]'s decision to invade [[Egypt]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] ended his political career and revealed Britain's weakness as an imperial power.]]

In 1951, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] returned to power in Britain, under the leadership of [[Winston Churchill]]. Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain's position as a world power relied on the continued existence of the empire, with the base at the [[Suez Canal]] allowing Britain to maintain its pre-eminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India. However, Churchill could not ignore [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Abdul Nasser]]'s new revolutionary [[Politics of Egypt|government of Egypt]] that had [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|taken power in 1952]], and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] would be granted self-determination by 1955, with independence to follow.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], pp.&amp;nbsp;339–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Sudan was granted independence on 1 January 1956.

In July 1956, Nasser unilaterally nationalised the Suez Canal. The response of [[Anthony Eden]], who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister, was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on [[Egypt]] that would give Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;581.&lt;/ref&gt; Eden infuriated US President [[Dwight D.

Eisenhower applied [[leverage (finance)|financial leverage]] by threatening to sell US reserves of the [[Pound sterling|British pound]] and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;356.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;583.&lt;/ref&gt; UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces, and Eden resigned.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCombs2008|Combs]], pp.&amp;nbsp;161–163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suez Crisis: Key players |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5195582.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 October 2010|date=21 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Suez Crisis]] very publicly exposed Britain's limitations to the world and confirmed Britain's decline on the world stage, demonstrating that henceforth it could no longer act without at least the acquiescence, if not the full support, of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;342.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBurk2008|Burk]], p.&amp;nbsp;602.&lt;/ref&gt; The events at Suez wounded British [[Patriotism|national pride]], leading one [[Member of Parliament|MP]] to describe it as &quot;Britain's [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;#refOHBEv4|Brown, p. 343&quot;&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;343.&lt;/ref&gt; and another to suggest that the country had become an &quot;American [[Satellite state|satellite]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;585.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Thatcher]] later described the mindset she believed had befallen the British political establishment as &quot;Suez syndrome&quot;, from which Britain did not recover until the successful recapture of the [[Falkland Islands]] from [[Argentina]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refThatcher|Thatcher]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Suez Crisis caused British power in the Middle East to weaken, it did not collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain again deployed its armed forces to the region, intervening in [[Oman]] ([[Jebel Akhdar War|1957]]), [[Jordan]] ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 127|1958]]) and [[Kuwait]] ([[Operation Vantage|1961]]), though on these occasions with American approval,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;586.&lt;/ref&gt; as the new Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]]'s foreign policy was to remain firmly aligned with the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;#refOHBEv4|Brown, p. 343&quot;/&gt; Britain maintained a military presence in the Middle East for another decade. In January 1968, a few weeks after the [[Pound sterling#Bretton Woods|devaluation of the pound]], Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] and his [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Denis Healey]] announced that British troops would be withdrawn from major military bases [[East of Suez]], which included the ones in the Middle East, and primarily from [[Malaysia]] and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPham2010|Pham 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt; The British withdrew from [[Aden]] in 1967, [[Bahrain]] in 1971, and [[Maldives]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;370–371.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wind of change ===
{{Main|Decolonization of Africa}}
[[File:British Decolonisation in Africa.png|thumb|British decolonisation in Africa. By the end of the 1960s, all but [[Rhodesia]] (the future Zimbabwe) and the South African mandate of [[South West Africa]] ([[Namibia]]) had achieved recognised independence.]]

Macmillan gave a [[Wind of Change (speech)|speech]] in [[Cape Town]], South Africa in February 1960 where he spoke of &quot;the wind of change blowing through this continent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;616.&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan wished to avoid the same kind of [[colonial war]] that France was fighting in [[Algerian War|Algeria]], and under his premiership decolonisation proceeded rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; To the three colonies that had been granted independence in the 1950s—[[Sudan]], the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] and [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]—were added nearly ten times that number during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;427–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's remaining colonies in Africa, except for [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] [[Southern Rhodesia]], were all granted independence by 1968. British withdrawal from the southern and eastern parts of Africa was not a peaceful process. Kenyan independence was preceded by the eight-year [[Mau Mau Uprising]]. In [[Rhodesia]], the 1965 [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] by the white minority resulted in a [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]] that lasted until the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] of 1979, which set the terms for recognised independence in 1980, as the new nation of [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], pp.&amp;nbsp;618–621.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Mediterranean, a guerrilla war waged by [[EOKA|Greek Cypriots]] ended in (1960) an independent [[Cyprus]], with the UK retaining the [[military base]]s of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]]. The [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|Mediterranean islands]] of [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]] were amicably granted independence from the UK in 1964, though the idea had been raised in 1955 of [[Maltese United Kingdom integration referendum, 1956|integration with Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSpringhall2001|Springhall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;100–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the UK's [[Caribbean]] territories achieved independence after the departure in 1961 and 1962 of [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad]] from the [[West Indies Federation]], established in 1958 in an attempt to unite the British Caribbean colonies under one government, but which collapsed following the loss of its two largest members.&lt;ref name=&quot;knight14&quot;&gt;[[#refKnight1989|Knight &amp; Palmer]], pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbados]] achieved independence in 1966 and the remainder of the eastern Caribbean islands in the 1970s and 1980s,&lt;ref name=&quot;knight14&quot;/&gt; but [[Anguilla]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] opted to revert to British rule after they had already started on the path to independence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refClegg2005|Clegg]], p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Virgin Islands]],&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;428.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Montserrat]] opted to retain ties with Britain,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;622.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Guyana]] achieved independence in 1966. Britain's last colony on the American mainland, [[British Honduras]], became a [[self-governing colony]] in 1964 and was renamed [[Belize]] in 1973, achieving full independence in 1981. A [[Belizean-Guatemalan territorial dispute|dispute with Guatemala]] over claims to Belize was left unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;401, 427–429.&lt;/ref&gt;

British territories in the Pacific acquired independence in the 1970s beginning with [[Fiji]] in 1970 and ending with [[Vanuatu]] in 1980.  Vanuatu's independence was delayed due to political conflict between English and French-speaking communities, as the islands had been jointly administered as a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] with France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMacdonald1994|Macdonald]], pp. 171–191.&lt;/ref&gt; Fiji, [[Tuvalu]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Papua New Guinea]] chose to become [[Commonwealth realm]]s.

=== End of empire ===
{{See also|Falklands War|Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong}}
&lt;!-- &quot;End of empire&quot; is a turn of phrase, please do not change to say &quot;the&quot; empire --&gt;

The independence of Rhodesia (as Zimbabwe), the New Hebrides (as Vanuatu) in 1980, and Belize in 1981 meant that, aside from a scattering of islands and outposts (and the acquisition in 1955 of an uninhabited rock in the Atlantic Ocean, [[Rockall]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=1955: Britain claims Rockall|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/21/newsid_4582000/4582327.stm|accessdate=13 December 2008 |date=21 September 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; the process of decolonisation that had begun after the Second World War was largely complete. In 1982, Britain's resolve in defending its remaining overseas territories was tested when [[Argentina]] [[Falklands War|invaded]] the [[Falkland Islands]], acting on a long-standing claim that dated back to the [[Spanish Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], pp.&amp;nbsp;624–625.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's ultimately successful military response to retake the islands during the ensuing [[Falklands War]] was viewed by many to have contributed to reversing the downward trend in Britain's status as a world power.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;629.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the Canadian government severed its last legal link with Britain by [[Patriation|patriating]] the Canadian constitution from Britain. The [[Canada Act 1982|1982 Canada Act]] passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] ended the need for British involvement in changes to the Canadian constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;refohbev594&quot;&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;594.&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalent acts were passed for [[Australia Act 1986|Australia]] and [[Constitution Act 1986|New Zealand]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;689.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1982, [[Prime minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] travelled to Beijing to negotiate with the Chinese government on the future of Britain's last major and most populous overseas territory, Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refBrendon|Brendon]], p.&amp;nbsp;654.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the 1842 [[Treaty of Nanking]], [[Hong Kong Island]] itself had been ceded to Britain ''in perpetuity'', but the vast majority of the colony was constituted by the [[New Territories]], which had been acquired under a [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory|99-year lease in 1898]], due to expire in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJoseph2010|Joseph]], p.&amp;nbsp;355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRothermund2006|Rothermund]], p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher, seeing parallels with the Falkland Islands, initially wished to hold Hong Kong and proposed British administration with Chinese sovereignty, though this was rejected by China.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refBrendon|Brendon]], pp.&amp;nbsp;654–55.&lt;/ref&gt; A deal was reached in 1984—under the terms of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], Hong Kong would become a [[special administrative region of the People's Republic of China]], maintaining its way of life for at least 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refBrendon|Brendon]], p.&amp;nbsp;656.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hong Kong handover ceremony|handover ceremony]] in 1997 marked for many,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brendon-Empire-end&quot;&gt;[[British Empire#refBrendon|Brendon]], p.&amp;nbsp;660.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Charles, Prince of Wales]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Prince-Charles-Empire-End&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4740684.stm|title=Charles' diary lays thoughts bare|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 December 2008 |date=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was in attendance, &quot;the end of Empire&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;refohbev594&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Empire-End&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/endofempire_overview_07.shtml|title=BBC – History – Britain, the Commonwealth and the End of Empire|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

Britain retains sovereignty over 14 territories outside the British Isles, which were renamed the [[British Overseas Territories]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFAC|House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee Overseas Territories Report]], pp.&amp;nbsp;145–147&lt;/ref&gt; Some are uninhabited except for transient military or scientific personnel; the remainder are self-governing to varying degrees and are reliant on the UK for [[Diplomacy|foreign relations]] and defence. The British government has stated its willingness to assist any Overseas Territory that wishes to proceed to independence, where that is an option.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFAC|House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee Overseas Territories Report, pp.&amp;nbsp;146,153]]&lt;/ref&gt; British sovereignty of several of the overseas territories is disputed by their geographical neighbours: [[Gibraltar]] is claimed by Spain, the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] are claimed by [[Argentina]], and the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] is claimed by [[Mauritius]] and [[Seychelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/io.html|title=British Indian Ocean Territory|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=CIA|accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Antarctic Territory]] is subject to overlapping claims by Argentina and [[Chile]], while many countries do not recognise any territorial claims in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFAC|House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee Overseas Territories Report]], p.&amp;nbsp;136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Location of the BOTs.svg|left|thumb|The fourteen [[British Overseas Territories]]]]
Most former British colonies and protectorates are members of [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a non-political, [[voluntary association]] of equal members. Sixteen members of the Commonwealth, including the UK, continue to share their [[head of state]] as [[Commonwealth realm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/150757/head_of_the_commonwealth/|title=Head of the Commonwealth|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat|accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades, and in some cases centuries, of British rule and emigration have left their mark on the independent nations that arose from the British Empire. The empire established the use of English in regions around the world. Today it is the primary language of up to 400 million people and is spoken by about one and a half billion as a first, second or foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHogg|Hogg]], p.&amp;nbsp;424 chapter 9 ''English Worldwide'' by [[David Crystal]]: &quot;approximately one in four of the worlds population are capable of communicating to a useful level in English.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of English from the latter half of the 20th century has been helped in part by the cultural influence of the United States, itself originally formed from British colonies. Except in Africa where nearly all the former colonies have adopted the [[presidential system]], the English [[parliamentary system]] has served as the template for the governments for many former colonies, and [[English law|English common law]] for legal systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;307.&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] still serves as the highest court of appeal for several former colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific. British [[Protestant]] [[missionary|missionaries]] who travelled around the globe often in advance of soldiers and civil servants spread the [[Anglican Communion]] to all continents. British colonial architecture, such as in churches, railway stations and government buildings, can be seen in many cities that were once part of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;238–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual and team sports developed in Britain—particularly [[association football|football]], [[cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[lawn tennis]] and golf—were also exported.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTorkildsen2005|Torkildsen]], p.&amp;nbsp;347.&lt;/ref&gt; The British choice of system of measurement, the [[Imperial units|imperial system]], continues to be used in some countries in various ways. The convention of [[Right- and left-hand traffic|driving on the left hand side of the road]] has been retained in much of the former empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refParsons|Parsons]], p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political boundaries drawn by the British did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions, contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas. The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples. Millions left the British Isles, with the founding settler populations of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland. Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities, and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Settlers in Ireland from Great Britain have left their mark in the form of divided [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] communities in [[Northern Ireland]]. Millions of people moved to and from British colonies, with large numbers of [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indians]] emigrating to other parts of the empire, such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Fiji]], and Chinese people to Malaysia, Singapore and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], p.&amp;nbsp;286.&lt;/ref&gt; The demographics of Britain itself was changed after the Second World War owing to [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922#Post-war immigration (1945–1983)|immigration to Britain]] from its former colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDalziel2006|Dalziel]], p.&amp;nbsp;135.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Burma/Myanmar
: The U.S. does not recognize the renaming of [[Burma]] by its ruling military junta to ''Myanmar'' and thus keeps its entry for the country under &quot;Burma&quot;. This is done because the name change &quot;was not approved by any sitting legislature in Burma&quot;.

In June 2009, the [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), relying on information obtained from the ''CIA World Factbook'', put the number of Israeli Jews living in settlements in the [[West Bank]] and Israeli-annexed [[East Jerusalem]] at 250,000. However, a better estimate, based on [[United States Department of State|State Department]] and Israeli sources put the figure at about 500,000. NPR then issued a correction. Chuck Holmes, foreign editor for NPR Digital, said, “I’m surprised and displeased, and it makes me wonder what other information is out-of-date or incorrect in the CIA World Factbook.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2010/06/01/127349281/cia-gets-the-numbers-wrong

Geographical information about countries in the ''CIA Factbook'' may not quite tally with information from government sources in those countries. For example, the ''Factbook'' gives the land area of [[Australia]] as 7,682,300&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Various demographic information is full of usually minor errors, inaccuracies, and out-of-date information, which are often repeated elsewhere due to the ''Factbook''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s widespread use as a reference. For example, [[Albania]] was. until recently, described in the ''Factbook'' as 70% [[Muslim]], 20% [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], and 10% [[Roman Catholic]], which was based on a survey conducted in 1939, before [[World War II]]; numerous surveys conducted since the fall of the Communist regime since 1990 have given quite different figures. Another example is [[Singapore]], which the ''Factbook'' states has a [[total fertility rate]] of 0.78 children per woman, despite figures in Statistics Singapore which state that the rate has been about 1.2–1.3 children per woman for at least the past several years, and it is unclear when, or even whether, it ever dropped as low as 0.78.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/latest_data.html#14 Statistics Singapore - Latest Data]. Singstat.gov.sg. Retrieved on 2014-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This low and inaccurate value then gets cited in news articles which state that Singapore has the world's lowest fertility, or at least use the figure for its shock value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sapere |first=Aude |url=http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/what-happens-when-half-the-world-stops-making-babies/573/ |title=What Happens When Half The World Stops Making Babies |publisher=The Global Mail |date=2013-03-12 |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/07d4c8a8-7e45-11e3-b409-00144feabdc0.html#slide0 |title=How Japan stood up to old age |publisher=The Financial Times |date=2014-01-17 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1998, the [[United Kingdom]] profile contained a sentence that asserted the UK had gained independence on 1 January 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author =  Directorate of Intelligence | title = The World Factbook – United Kingdom (mirror) |year= 1996 | url =  http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact96/258.htm | accessdate = September 23, 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This description in reference to the [[Act of Union 1801]] which expanded the United Kingdom of Great Britain to include Ireland, has since been greatly expanded,&lt;ref name=&quot;uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author =  Directorate of Intelligence | title = The World Factbook – United Kingdom |date= 2006-09-19 | url =  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uk.html | accessdate = 2006-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the primary date of UK Independence is now given as 1927. This has been argued by some as misleading, and refers to the date the entity adopted its current name under the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act]], of that year. Indeed it can be argued the country has no one year in which independence was achieved, since there is an arguable legitimate succession of states, systems and entities from the [[Norman Conquest]], 1066.
